Despite the routine use of continuous electroencephalographic monitoring, accidental awareness during general anaesthesia remains relatively frequent and constitutes a significant additional cost. The prediction of patients’ arousal during general anaesthesia could help preventing accidental awareness and some researchers have suggested that heart rate variability (HRV) analysis contains valuable information about the patient arousal during general anaesthesia. We conducted pilot study to investigate HRV ability to detect patient arousal. RR series and the Bispectral IndexTM (BISTM) were recorded during general anaesthesia. The pre-arousal period T0 was defined as the time at which the BISTM exceeded 60 at the end of surgery. HRV parameters were computed over several time periods before and after T0 and classified as “BISTM<60” or “BISTM≥60”. A multivariate logistic regression model and a classification and regression tree algorithm were used to evaluate the HRV variables’ ability to detect “BISTM≥60”. All the models gave high specificity but poor sensitivity. Excluding T0 from the classification increased the sensitivity for all the models and gave AUCROC>0.7. In conclusion, we found that HRV analysis provided encouraging results to predict arousal at the end of general anaesthesia."

The main downside to such setups is the bad quality of recorded data due to movement, noises, and data losses. These errors may considerably alter HRV analysis and should therefore be addressed beforehand, especially if used for medical diagnosis. One widely used method to handle such problems is interpolation, but this approach does not preserve the time dependence of the signal. In this study, we propose a new method for HRV processing including filtering and iterative data imputation using a Gaussian distribution. The particularity of the method is that many physiological aspects are taken into consideration, such as HRV distribution, RR variability, and normal boundaries, as well as time series characteristics. We study the effect of this method on classification using a random forest classifier (RF) and compare it to other data imputation methods including linear, shape-preserving piecewise cubic Hermite (pchip), and spline interpolation in a case study on stress. Features from reconstructed HRV signals of 67 healthy subjects using all four methods were analysed and separately classified by a random forest algorithm to detect stress against relaxation. The proposed method reached a stable F1 score of 61% even with a high percentage of missing data, whereas other interpolation methods reached approximately 54% F1 score for a low percentage of missing data, and the performance drops to about 44% when the percentage is increased. This suggests that our method gives better results for stress classification, especially on signals with a high percentage of missing data."

Heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse transit time variability (PTTV) are two important time series variabilities. However, combining HRV and PTTV can enhance the classification accuracy for heart failure which is unknown. In this paper, a simultaneous analysis of HRV and PTTV performed on both normal subjects and heart failure patients, was carried out, aiming to investigate the improvement of HRV-based heart failure detection with the assistant of PTTV analysis. Forty normal subjects and forty heart failure patients were enrolled. Standard limb lead-II electrocardiogram and radial artery pressure waveforms were synchronously recorded. HRV and PTTV analysis were performed on the acquired RR and PTT time series using the standard time- (MEAN, SDNN, and RMSSD), frequency- (LF, HF, and LF/HF), and non-linear (SD1, SD2, sample entropy, and fuzzy measure entropy) domain indices. The results showed that all HRV indices except MEAN (P = 0.1) and LF/HF (P = 0.9) showed significant differences (all P <0.01) between the two group, while only MEAN in PTTV significantly decreases in heart failure patients (P < 0.01). Moreover, when combined the HRV, PTTV indices, and the predicted probabilities generated from the distance distribution matrix-based convolutional neural network models, the highest classification performances were achieved by a support vector machine classifier, outputting a sensitivity of 0.93, a specificity of 0.88, and an accuracy of 0.90. This paper demonstrated the potential of PTTV analysis for the detection of clinical heart failure."

HRV indices were calculated using fast Fourier transform (FFT). The classification was performed using Logistic Regression (LGR), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB, v2.9.2), One-Class SVM (OCS), Isolation Forest (ILF), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). A balanced dataset of 5 min and 10 min segments was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation (k = 3, 4, 5). Performance metrics, including recall, F-score, and PR-AUC, were computed for each classifier. Grid search was applied to optimize parameters for LGR, RF, and XGB, while default settings were used for the other classifiers. Among all models, OCS with k = 3 achieved the highest classification accuracy for both 5 min and 10 min data.

After appropriate acquisition and preprocessing electrocardiogram (ECG) signal may be analyzed in different ways revealing not only current status of atrial and ventricular electrical activity of heart muscle but also information about sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, thermoregulation and vasomotor tone, renin-angiotensin control systems, baroreceptor reflex and blood pressure regulation, respiratory activity etc. Heart rate variability (HRV) defined as a timing of the sequence of QRS complexes is one of the most promising quantitative markers of autonomic activity. Different mathematical indices in time and frequency domain were designed to extract full details valuable for diagnostic purposes. Presented paper is the first one of the series of articles describing mathematical methodology of heart rate (HR) signal processing and further classification of obtained markers. The ultimate goal is to find optimal set of HR descriptors which support diagnosis in different cardiac pathologies. 1 . I N T R O D U C T I O N Electrocardiogram is one of best known and deeply analysed biomedical signals. Direct approach based on examination of changes in the temporal durations of the segments between deflections, intervals between waves, their relative amplitudes is the essential way of interpretation of the ECG wave patterns. A wide spectrum of various mathematical methods in time, frequency and joined time-frequency domains are used to extract most distinctive features of the ECG which may be used as the markers in different pathologies. These markers should have not only the best sensitivity and specificity, but they should be maximally noninvasive, readily available and inexpensive. The intensive research proved the existence of significant relationship between the autonomic nervous system and cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) estimated as the recurrent changes in R -R intervals can be good prognostic indicator for large amount of different disease states. Decreased HRV is a powerful predictor of arrhythmic complications and cardiac death. It is treated as a versatile test to determine risk stratification and supports the choice of treatment strategies. Tens of different HRV indices vere designed for assessing the integrity of cardiovascular homeostasis. Some of them (i.e. SDNN, RMSSD, HRV triangular index in time domain 66 Advanced Methods of Heart Rate Signals Processing or LF, HF, LF/HF ratio in frequency domain) are most frequently used in clinical practice due to relatively simple interpretation and good prognostic properties. Comprehensive review of these indices prepared as task force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology may be found in [1], Teich et al. [2] examined suitability for correctly classifying ECG records as normal or representing the presence of cardiac dysfunction on the basis of sixteen different HRV measures. These papers were the inspiration for further investigations on HRV indices properties, which we performed in cooperation with Cardiology Department of our university. Presented paper is the first one of the series presenting different mathematical approaches to diagnosis support. We present virtual instrumentation designed for ECG signal acquisition and processing. This instrumentation is the source of the set of thirty six HRV descriptors in time, frequency and joined time-frequency domain estimated for normal or pathological ECG recordings. The obtained database allows for checking the suitability of particular indices for discrimination patients with different cardiac pathologies from normal subjects. The difference between Teich et al. and our results yields from the fact of using multivariate instead of univariate approach. Various classification methods (multivariate statistical techniques such as general discriminant analysis, classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, generation of relevant fuzzy rules) and their usefullness in diagnosis support is discussed. 2 . H E A R T R A T E V A R I A B I L I T Y I N D I C E S The mathematical structure of most known HRV indices is based on statistical parameters such as arithmetic mean value, standard deviation, interquartile range. Some of them are estimated directly from R -R intervals, the other incorporate heart rate (HR) values calculated with hyperbolic dependence where TR_R is expressed in miliseconds, HR in beat per minutes (bpm). One can divide them into three subgroups: 1) long-term variability indices which describe slow changes in HR (low frequencies), 2) short-term variability indices describing changes in consecutive R-R intervals (high frequencies), 3) total variability indices taking into account all sources of variation (full band spectrum). The group of time domain measures (not directly related to specific cycle length) include following indices: 1) SDNN index is defined as standard deviation of subsequent R -R intervals. This measure is sensitive to all sources of variation (both longand short-term variability)."

The objective of this study is to identify the most suitable methods for application in a clinical setting. Ranking methods are employed to assign ranks to features extracted from heart rate variability (HRV) data by spectral and chaos investigation methods, organizing them based on their clinical significance. Initially, 30 and 10 different features are extracted from HRV time-series signals using popular HRV analysis methods, including spectral and nonlinear investigation techniques. Among these, 5 spectral features are derived from the auto-regression (AR) model, 15 from multiscale Wavelet packet (MSWP) decomposition, and 10 from higher-order spectra (HOS). The top ten features from each method are selected and ranked using Fisher score, Wilcoxon, receiver operating characteristics (ROC), entropy, and Bhattacharya space methods. Numerical results demonstrate that features at the third level of MSWP decomposition exhibit the lowest p-value (<<0.0001). Given that features with the lowest p-value possess the highest discrimination ability, the third-level MSWP features outperform other features extracted by AR and HOS spectral methods in HRV dataset analysis. Furthermore, features such as CD, DFA:α₂, ApEn, SaEn, and SD1/SD2, derived from chaos investigation methods, consistently display the lowest p-values compared to all considered features. Consequently, these features are identified as optimal choices for HRV analysis of datasets."

This study aimed to investigate the complexity or irregularity of the RR interval time series in different sleep stages and explore their values in sleep staging. We performed approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), distribution entropy (DistEn), conditional entropy (CE), and permutation entropy (PermEn) analyses on RR interval time series extracted from epochs that were constructed based on two methods: (1) 270-s epoch length and (2) 300-s epoch length. To test whether adding the entropy measures can improve the accuracy of sleep staging using linear HRV indices, XGBoost was used to examine the abilities to differentiate among: (i) 5 classes [Wake (W), non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM), which can be divide into 3 sub-stages: stage N1, stage N2, and stage N3, and rapid-eye-movement (REM)]; (ii) 4 classes [W, light sleep (combined N1 and N2), deep sleep (N3), and REM]; and (iii) 3 classes: (W, NREM, and REM). SampEn, FuzzyEn, and CE significantly increased from W to N3 and decreased in REM. DistEn increased from W to N1, decreased in N2, and further decreased in N3; it increased in REM. The average accuracy of the three tasks using linear and entropy features were 42.1%, 59.1%, and 60.8%, respectively, based on 270-s epoch length; all were significantly lower than the performance based on 300-s epoch length (i.e., 54.3%, 63.1%, and 67.5%, respectively). Adding entropy measures to the XGBoost model of linear parameters did not significantly improve the classification performance. However, entropy measures, especially PermEn, DistEn, and FuzzyEn, demonstrated greater importance than most of the linear parameters in the XGBoost model.300-s270-s."

The heart rate variability (HRV) is based on measuring (time) intervals between R-peaks (of RR-intervals) of an electrocardiogram (ECG) and plotting a rhythmogram on their basis with its subsequent analysis by various mathematical methods which are classified as Time-Domain (TD), Frequency-Domain (FD) and Nonlinear [1, 2]. There are a number of popular Nonlinear methods used in HRV analysis, such as entropy-based measures that mostly applied for TD. Spectral Entropy (SE) is using for Frequency-Domain: it is defined to be the Shannon entropy of the power spectral density (PSD) of the data. An important characteristic of Frequency-Domain studies is sympatho-vagal balance, which has been overlooked by entropy-based analysis. This is due to the fact that good entropy analysis restricted the number of existing HRV data, which is shrinking in FD and also in total spectrum parts. Aim of the research. The goal of this paper is to provide a reliable formula for calculating entropy accurately for Frequency-domain of standard 5-min. HRV records and to show the advantages of such approach for analyzing of sympatho-vagal balance for healthy subjects (NSR), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients. Materials and Methods. We used MIT-BIH long-term HRV records for Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF). The generalized form of the Robust Entropy Estimator (EnRE) for Frequency-domain of standard 5-min. HRV records was proposed and the key EnRE futures was shown. The difference between means of the two independent selections (NSR and CHF, before and after AF) has been determined by a t-test for independent samples; discriminant analysis and statistical calculations have been done by using the statistical package IBM SPSS 27. The results of the study. We calculate entropy for all valuable for HRV spectral interval, namely 0–0.4 Hz and to compare with existing results for Spectral Entropy: qualitatively we receive the same distribution number as [14] and significant difference (p < 0.001) between entropy averages for NSR and CHF or AF patients. We define low-frequencies (LF) power spectrum components in the range of 0.04–0.15 Hz and high-frequencies (HF) power spectrum components in the range of 0.15–0.4 Hz [1]. The sympatho-vagal balance is a simple ratio LF/HF [1]. Then, we define an entropy eLF of the LF power spectrum components, an entropy eHF of the HF power spectrum components and entropy based sympatho-vagal balance as a ratio eLF/eHF. The difference between NSR and CHF groups are significant in both cases LF/HF and eLF/eHF with p < 0.001, but in case of eLF/eHF the results are quite better (t = -4.8, compared to LF/HF where t = -4.4). The discriminant analysis shows total classification accuracy for eLF/eHF in 79.3 % (χ2 = 19.4, p < 0.001) and for LF/HF in 72.4 % (χ2 = 16.6, p < 0.001). We applied entropy-based Frequencies-domain analyzing for AF patients and showed that ratio eLF/eHF is significantly higher during AF than before AF (p < 0.001). This is opposite to ordinary LF/HF where difference is insignificant due to high variation of this ratio. Conclusion. Proposed in the article is generalized form for Robust Entropy Estimator EnRE for Frequencies-domain, which allows, for time series of a limited length (standard 5-min. records), to find entropy value of HRV power spectrum (total spectrum, low- and high- frequencies bands). Using the proposed EnRE for MIT-BIH database of HRV records, we show for standard 5 min. HRV records the usage of EnRE of HRV power spectrum and entropy-based sympatho-vagal balance of Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) cases. It is demonstrated, that, entropy-based Frequencies-domain analyzing is applicable for case of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) even during AF episodes. We showed the significant difference (p < 0.001) before and during AF for entropy of total spectrum, as well as for sympatho-vagal balance in form of eLF/eHF."

They can lead to attention deficits, as well as cardiac, neurological and behavioral repercussions. One of the most widely used methods for assessing sleep disorders is polysomnography (PSG). A major challenge associated with this method is all the cables needed to connect the recording devices, making the examination more intrusive and usually requiring a clinical environment. This can have potential consequences on the test results and their accuracy. One simple way to assess the state of the central nervous system (CNS), a well-known indicator of sleep disorder, could be the use of a portable medical device. With this in mind, we implemented a simple model using both the RR interval (RRI) and its second derivative to accurately predict the awake and napping states of a subject using a feature classification model. For training and validation, we used a database providing measurements from nine healthy young adults (six men and three women), in which heart rate variability (HRV) associated with light-on, light-off, sleep onset and sleep offset events. Results show that using a 30 min RRI time series window suffices for this lightweight model to accurately predict whether the patient was awake or napping."

In this model we also integrate other feature extraction techniques, the cepstrum coefficients derived from the same HRV and a set of band powers obtained from the electrocardiogram derived respiratory (EDR) signal. The aim of the model is detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) events. For this purpose, we apply two statistical classification methods: Logistic Regression (LR) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). For testing the models we use seventy ECG recordings from the Physionet database which are divided into equal-size learning and testing sets. Both sets consist of 35 recordings, each containing a single ECG signal. In our experiments we have found that the features extracted from the EDR signal present a sensitivity of 65.6% and specificity of 87.7% (auc = 85) in the LR classifier, and sensitivity of 59.4% and specificity of 90.3% (auc = 83.9) in the QDA classifier. The HRV-based cepstrum coefficients present a sensitivity of 63.8% and specificity of 89.2% (auc = 86) in the LR classifier, and sensitivity of 67.2% and specificity of 86.8% (auc = 86.9) in the QDA. Subsequent tests show that the contribution of the permutation entropy increases the performance of the classifiers, implying that the complexity of RR interval time series play an important role in the breathing pauses detection. Particularly, when all features are jointly used, the quantification task reaches a sensitivity of 71.9% and specificity of 92.1% (auc = 90.3) for LR. Similarly, for QDA the sensitivity is 75.1% and the specificity is 90.5% (auc = 91.7)."

However, very few prospective studies have addressed the extent to which changes in pain associate with changes in autonomic cardiac regulation. Therefore, we investigated if changes in pain vary with changes in heart rate variability in a cohort of patients treated for persistent or recurrent neck pain. Method This analysis is based on data from a randomized controlled trial in which participants were given home stretching exercises with or without spinal manipulative therapy for two weeks. As the effectiveness of the intervention (home stretching exercises and spinal manipulative therapy) was found to be equal to the control (home stretching exercises alone), all 127 participants were studied as one cohort in this analysis. During the intervention, pain levels were recorded using daily text messages, and heart rate variability was measured in the clinics three times over two weeks. Two approaches were used to classify patients based on changes in pain intensity: 1) Clinically important changes in pain were categorized as either ""improved"" or ""not improved"" and, 2) Pain development was measured using pain trajectories, constructed in a data driven approach. The association of pain categories and trajectories with changes in heart rate variability indices over time were then analysed using linear mixed models. Results Heart rate variability did not differ significantly between improved and not-improved patients, nor were there any associations with the different pain trajectories. Conclusions In conclusion, changes in pain after home stretching exercises with or without spinal manipulative therapy over two weeks were not significantly associated with changes in heart rate variability for patients with persistent or recurrent neck pain. Future studies should rely on more frequent measurements of HRV during longer treatment periods. Trial registration The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number: NCT03576846."

 Nowadays research on Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) and attention towards novel technology allowing real-time assessment of car drivers' psycho-physiological status is growing, to quantify driver's stress during semi-autonomous or autonomous driving assistance and to investigate human reaction to different types of ADS. We present a system for automatic stress detection with combined machine learning analysis of Skin Potential Response (SPR) and electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings to compare the driver's stress reaction during both manual and autonomous driving sessions carried out in a dynamic professional drive simulator (PDS).
 
 
 
 All data were acquired after informed consent from 14 healthy volunteers (HVs) in the Vi-grade (Udine) PDS. Two SPR signals (one from each hand) and three chest ECG leads were recorded. A Motion Artifact (MA) removal algorithm was used to remove motion artifacts from SPR signals. A cleaned, single SPR signal, obtained as the RMS value by combining the two original signals, was then sent together with the time-variation of heart rate (HR) to a Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithm, i.e., a Support Vector Machine (SVM), based on some specific features of this signal. The output of the SVM provides a series of labels, that indicate the presence or lack of stress episodes during the driving experiment. Stress occurrence was also independently quantified with heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in the time (TD) and frequency (FD) domains and with non-linear (NL) methods.
 
 
 
 All participants completed the driving protocol consisting of two subsequent sessions, one with conventional manual (MD) and the other with autonomous (AD) driving settings, along a highway where some unexpected events occurred, inducing different level stress response.
 Figure 1 shows an example of time variant changes of the RMS SPR signal and of the HR of one tested individual during both experimental settings. A simultaneous increase of both SPR and HR signal is apparent during the stress episodes correctly identified by the SVM (gray shadows). Discriminant analysis of FD (VLF, LF and HF) and NL (SD1, SD2, Entropy and Recurrence Plot) HRV parameters, independently assessed by two researchers blind to SVM results, differentiated between stress induced by MD and AD (accuracy: 88,4% cross-correlated) in good agreement with automatic SVM assessment. In general stress level was lower during the AD, being all HRV parameters not significantly modified from baseline rest. SPR amplitude eventually increased also during AD, but SVM efficiently differentiated between AD and MD stress anyhow.
 
 
 
 The proposed method for automatic assessment of stress reactions of car drivers with SVM of SPR and HR signals is reliable, in both MD and AD scenarios. The results seem to evidence that MD is in general more demanding than AD inducing higher activation of sympathetic nervous system, especially in critical situations.

Mills Dvm; Dacvecc Marla Lichtenberger Dvm; and Piper L. Wall Dvm; Dacvecc Dacvim Rebecca Kirby Dvm,2002.0,0,[],"Objective: To explore the potential value of transesophageally-determined descending thoracic aortic blood flow parameters in critically ill dogs undergoing surgery. 
 
 
 
Design: Observational case series. 
 
 
 
Setting: Private small animal referral hospital. 
 
 
 
Animals: Ten anesthetized critically ill dogs that underwent emergent surgery. 
 
 
 
Interventions: Placement of the ultrasonic transesophageal probe. 
 
 
 
Measurements and main results: Transesophageally-determined descending thoracic aortic blood flow, stroke volume, blood velocity, blood acceleration, left ventricular ejection time interval, and heart rate parameters were recorded every minute. Systolic and mean arterial blood pressures were non-invasively determined and recorded at 1–5 minute intervals. The anesthetist and surgeon were blinded to the descending thoracic aortic blood flow parameters. All dogs received fluid challenges as part of their management, and 2 dogs received dopamine. The variability of the descending thoracic aortic blood flow parameters within each dog was greater than has been reported in non-critically ill anesthetized dogs. Consistent trends in descending thoracic aortic blood flow parameters after fluid challenges were not found. An escalating dopamine infusion was, however, accompanied by increasing aortic blood flow, stroke volume, acceleration, and peak velocity. 
 
 
 
Conclusions: Descending thoracic aortic blood flow parameters may eventually be useful for evaluating the responses to and suggesting the need for cardiovascular interventions during emergent surgeries in anesthetized critically ill canine patients. For this to occur, more experience with this technology will be required."
