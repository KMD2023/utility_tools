CSF hypocretin-1 was measured in 47 cases to document hypocretin deficiency. A subgroup (\u0026quot;narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency\u0026quot;) with likely hypocretin deficiency (low hypocretin-1 or HLA positive with clear-cut cataplexy) was further examined for presentations prior to, around, or after puberty.\n\nNarcolepsy with (n = 361) or without (n = 17) cataplexy presented at an earlier age and with increased male predominance when compared to idiopathic hypersomnia (n = 39, P \u0026lt; 0.01). Nearly 70% of those with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (n = 271) had disease onset before age 10 y, and 15% had onset before age 6, an unusually young age distribution. Onset was prior to puberty in 78% of cases. Clinical features were similar in presentations across puberty groups except for sleep paralysis, which increased in frequency with age/puberty. Mean sleep latency (MSL) decreased and the number of sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) increased with age/puberty, but MSLT diagnosis criteria (MSL \u2264 8 min, \u2265 2 SOREMPs) were similarly positive across groups.

The association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*0602 and T-cell receptor alpha locus suggests that autoimmunity plays a role in narcolepsy. A recent study reported an increased prevalence of autoantibodies against Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) in patients with narcolepsy. To replicate this finding, we examined anti-TRIB2 autoantibodies in Japanese patients with narcolepsy.\n\nWe examined anti-TRIB2 autoantibodies against a full-length [35S]-labeled TRIB2 antigen in Japanese patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy (n = 88), narcolepsy without cataplexy (n = 18), and idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time (n = 11). The results were compared to Japanese healthy controls (n = 87). Thirty-seven healthy control subjects were positive for HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602. We also examined autoantibodies against another Tribbles homolog, TRIB3, as an experimental control.\n\nAutoantibodies against TRIB2 were found in 26.1% of patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, a significantly higher prevalence than the 2.3% in healthy controls.

The association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*0602 and T-cell receptor alpha locus suggests that autoimmunity plays a role in narcolepsy. A recent study reported an increased prevalence of autoantibodies against Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) in patients with narcolepsy. To replicate this finding, we examined anti-TRIB2 autoantibodies in Japanese patients with narcolepsy.\n\nWe examined anti-TRIB2 autoantibodies against a full-length [35S]-labeled TRIB2 antigen in Japanese patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy (n = 88), narcolepsy without cataplexy (n = 18), and idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time (n = 11). The results were compared to Japanese healthy controls (n = 87). Thirty-seven healthy control subjects were positive for HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602. We also examined autoantibodies against another Tribbles homolog, TRIB3, as an experimental control.\n\nAutoantibodies against TRIB2 were found in 26.1% of patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, a significantly higher prevalence than the 2.3% in healthy controls. We found that anti-TRIB3 autoantibodies were rare in patients with narcolepsy and showed no association with anti-TRIB2 indices.

This manifests as excessive daytime sleepiness and expression of individual physiological correlates of REM sleep that include cataplexy and sleep paralysis (REM sleep atonia intruding into wakefulness), impaired maintenance of REM sleep atonia (e.g. REM sleep behaviour disorder [RBD]), and dream imagery intruding into wakefulness (e.g. hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations). Excessive sleepiness typically begins in the second or third decade followed by expression of auxiliary symptoms. Only cataplexy exhibits a high specificity for diagnosis of narcolepsy. While the natural history is poorly defined, narcolepsy appears to be lifelong but not progressive. Mild disease severity, misdiagnoses or long delays in cataplexy expression often cause long intervals between symptom onset, presentation and diagnosis. Only 15-30% of narcoleptic individuals are ever diagnosed or treated, and nearly half first present for diagnosis after the age of 40 years. Attention to periodic leg movements (PLM), sleep apnoea and RBD is particularly important in the management of the older narcoleptic patient, in whom these conditions are more likely to occur. Diagnosis requires nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) followed by multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT). The NPSG of a narcoleptic patient may be totally normal, or demonstrate the patient has a short nocturnal REM sleep latency, exhibits unexplained arousals or PLM. The MSLT diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy include short sleep latencies (\u0026lt;8 minutes) and at least two naps with sleep-onset REM sleep. Treatment includes counselling as to the chronic nature of narcolepsy, the potential for developing further symptoms reflective of REM sleep dyscontrol, and the hazards associated with driving and operating machinery. Elderly narcoleptic patients, despite age-related decrements in sleep quality, are generally less sleepy and less likely to evidence REM sleep dyscontrol. Nonpharmacological management also includes maintenance of a strict wake-sleep schedule, good sleep hygiene, the benefits of afternoon naps and a programme of regular exercise. Thereafter, treatment is highly individualised, depending on the severity of daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and sleep disruption. Wake-promoting agents include the traditional psychostimulants. More recently, treatment with the \u0026#x27;activating\u0026#x27; antidepressants and the novel wake-promoting agent modafinil has been advocated. Cataplexy is especially responsive to antidepressants which enhance synaptic levels of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and/or serotonin. Obstructive sleep apnoea and PLMs are more common in narcolepsy and should be suspected when previously well controlled older narcolepsy patients exhibit a worsening of symptoms.

Only 15-30% of narcoleptic individuals are ever diagnosed or treated, and nearly half first present for diagnosis after the age of 40 years. Attention to periodic leg movements (PLM), sleep apnoea and RBD is particularly important in the management of the older narcoleptic patient, in whom these conditions are more likely to occur. Diagnosis requires nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) followed by multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT). The NPSG of a narcoleptic patient may be totally normal, or demonstrate the patient has a short nocturnal REM sleep latency, exhibits unexplained arousals or PLM. The MSLT diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy include short sleep latencies (\u0026lt;8 minutes) and at least two naps with sleep-onset REM sleep. Treatment includes counselling as to the chronic nature of narcolepsy, the potential for developing further symptoms reflective of REM sleep dyscontrol, and the hazards associated with driving and operating machinery. Elderly narcoleptic patients, despite age-related decrements in sleep quality, are generally less sleepy and less likely to evidence REM sleep dyscontrol. Nonpharmacological management also includes maintenance of a strict wake-sleep schedule, good sleep hygiene, the benefits of afternoon naps and a programme of regular exercise. Thereafter, treatment is highly individualised, depending on the severity of daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and sleep disruption. Wake-promoting agents include the traditional psychostimulants. More recently, treatment with the \u0026#x27;activating\u0026#x27; antidepressants and the novel wake-promoting agent modafinil has been advocated. Cataplexy is especially responsive to antidepressants which enhance synaptic levels of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and/or serotonin. Obstructive sleep apnoea and PLMs are more common in narcolepsy and should be suspected when previously well controlled older narcolepsy patients exhibit a worsening of symptoms. The discovery that narcolepsy/cataplexy results from the absence of neuroexcitatory properties of the hypothalamic hypocretin-peptidergic system will significantly advance understanding and treatment of the symptom complex in the future.\u003c/div\u003e", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12696996/"}, {"abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and PSG characteristics of narcolepsy with cataplexy and their genetic predisposition by using the retrospective patient database of the European Narcolepsy Network (EU-NN).

Non-DQB1*0602 allelic effects were also observed but could not be interpreted in the context of DQB1*0602 overabundance and linkage disequilibrium. We therefore next analyzed compound heterozygote effects in 77 subjects with either hypocretin deficiency or cataplexy and one copy of DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602, a sample constructed to maximize etiologic homogeneity. In this analysis, we found additional predisposing effects of DQB1*0301 and protective effects for DQA1*0103-DQB1*0601. Unexpectedly, the predisposing effects of DQB1*0301 were present in the context of various DQA1-bearing haplotypes. A predisposing effect of DQA1*0303 was also suggested.

The results of the neuropsychological testing indicated that all patients fell within the mild to moderate impairment range. The results of overnight polysomnography and MSLT data, along with patient histories, indicated a diagnosis of narcolepsy in all cases. The results of HLA typing indicated that three patients were DR2 positive, two were DR4 positive and one was DQW1 positive. We conclude that narcolepsy may be \u0026quot;dormant\u0026quot; and that, in cases genetically at risk, even a minor injury to the central nervous system can cause that person to become symptomatic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\u003c/div\u003e", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7701196/"}, {"abstract": "Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that afflicts 1 in 2000 individuals and is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy-a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by positive emotions.

A familial background is often present but rigorous studies are still lacking. The key manifestation is hypersomnolence. It is often accompanied by sleep of long duration and debilitating sleep inertia. Polysomnography (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is mandatory, as well as a 24\u00a0h\u00a0PSG or a 2-wk actigraphy in association with a sleep log to ensure a total 24-h\u00a0sleep time longer than or equal to 66O minutes, when the mean sleep latency on the MSLT is longer than 8\u00a0min. Yet, MSLT is neither sensitive nor specific and the polysomnographic diagnostic criteria require continuous readjustment and biologic markers are still lacking. Idiopathic hypersomnia is most often a chronic condition though spontaneous remission may occur. The condition is disabling, sometimes even more so than narcolepsy type 1 or 2. Based on neurochemical, genetic and immunological analyses as well as on exploration of the homeostatic and circadian processes of sleep, various pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed. Differential diagnosis involves a number of diseases and it is not yet clear whether idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy type 2 are not the same condition. Until now, the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia has mirrored that of the sleepiness of narcolepsy type 1 or 2. The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of modafinil have just been published, as well as a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of clarithromycine, a negative allosteric modulator of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-A receptor.\u003c/div\u003e", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26599679/"}, {"abstract": "To evaluate the reliability of nocturnal sleep dynamics in the differential diagnosis of central disorders of hypersomnolence.\n\nCross-sectional.\n\nSleep laboratory.\n\nOne hundred seventy-five patients with hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, n = 79), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2, n = 22), idiopathic hypersomnia (IH, n = 22), and \u0026quot;subjective\u0026quot; hypersomnolence (sHS, n = 52).\n\nNone.\n\nPolysomnographic (PSG) work-up included 48 h of continuous PSG recording.

Decreased frequency of CMMCs mediated by IgG with anti-M3R activity was reversed by neostigmine. Therefore, a challenge with a cholinesterase inhibitor improves the specificity of the CMMC assay for narcoleptic IgG. Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neuronal sodium channel blocker, also abolished CMMCs and increased resting tone, and a similar potentiation was observed with neostigmine; thus, TTX is a mimic of the functional effects of the narcoleptic IgG in this bioassay. These findings provide a link to pharmacological studies of canine narcolepsy and are consistent with a functional blockade of both excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons by the narcoleptic Ab, similar to the TTX mimic, presumably by binding to an autoantigenic target expressed in both populations of neurons.\u003c/div\u003e", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19806080/"}, {"abstract": "A study of the pattern of Sleep/Wake disturbance in frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\n\nSleep diaries and prolonged actigraphy were used to record the activity, sleep and wake of 13 patients with a clinical diagnosis of FTD.

Moreover, gamma aminobutyric acid displayed a negative correlation with rapid eye movement sleep latency (REML), and thus might represent an intriguing target for future studies to elucidate how the controlling circuit of REM sleep is associated with abnormally short REML in NT1.\u003c/div\u003e", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32412602/"}, {"abstract": "Orexin A (OXA) and orexin B were originally isolated as hypothalamic peptides regulating sleep, wakefulness and feeding.

Wake-promoting compounds are used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and anticataplectics are used for cataplexy. The treatment of EDS includes the use of amphetamine-like CNS stimulants (such as dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate), modafinil, and its R-enantiomer, armodafinil. Because of its high safety and low side-effect profiles, modafinil has become the first-line treatment of choice for EDS associated with narcolepsy.

Recent reports suggest that loss of orexin-containing neurons occurs in human patients with narcolepsy. We generated transgenic mice in which orexin-containing neurons are ablated by orexinergic-specific expression of a truncated Machado-Joseph disease gene product (ataxin-3) with an expanded polyglutamine stretch. These mice showed a phenotype strikingly similar to human narcolepsy, including behavioral arrests, premature entry into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, poorly consolidated sleep patterns, and a late-onset obesity, despite eating less than nontransgenic littermates.

The purpose of this review is to summarize how behavioral procedures, especially drug discrimination procedures, have been used to study the mechanism of action of GHB. More specifically, we will review several different drug discrimination procedures and discuss how they have been used to qualitatively and quantitatively study different components of the complex mechanism of action of GHB. A growing number of studies have provided evidence that the behavioral effects of GHB are mediated predominantly by GABAB receptors. However, there is also evidence that the mechanisms mediating the effects of GHB and the prototypical GABAB receptor agonist baclofen are not identical, and that other mechanisms such as GHB receptors and subtypes of GABAA and GABAB receptors might contribute to the effects of GHB. These findings are consistent with the different behavioral profile, abuse liability, and therapeutic indications of GHB and baclofen. A better understanding of the similarities and differences between GHB and baclofen, as well as the pharmacological mechanisms of action underlying the recreational and therapeutic effects of GHB, could lead to more effective medications with fewer adverse effects.\u003c/div\u003e", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19010351/"}, {"abstract": "Narcolepsy types 1 and 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia are primary Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders of hypersomnolence characterized by profound daytime sleepiness and/or excessive sleep need.

T lymphocyte P2Y11 protein levels were significantly lower in patients and relatives homozygous for the rs2305795 risk A allele (CD4: p = 0.012; CD8: p = 0.007). The nocturnal sleep fragmentation index was significantly negatively correlated with patients\u0026#x27; P2Y11 protein levels (CD4: p = 0.004; CD8: p = 0.006). Mean MSLT sleep latency, REM-sleep latency, and core clinical symptoms were not associated with P2Y11 protein levels.\n\nWe confirmed that the P2RY11 polymorphism rs2305795 is associated with NT1 also in a mainly H1N1-(Pandemrix)-vaccinated cohort. We demonstrated that homozygosity for the A risk allele is associated with lower P2Y11 protein levels. A high level of nocturnal sleep fragmentation was associated with low P2Y11 levels in patients.

The subgroup defined by two or more SOREMPs included many patients without cataplexy. A disproportionate number of these subjects were older women whose chances of developing cataplexy are remote. This group of older women had a higher number of periodic leg movements during sleep than the other groups. Patients with both cataplexy and two or more SOREMPs have the greatest chance of being DR2 DQw1 positive. Thus, the combination of history of cataplexy and two or more SOREMPs is the best clinical determinant of narcolepsy.

Each is a separate and distinct neuronal population, but they project to similar target areas in the brain. Orexin has been implicated in regulating arousal since loss of orexin neurons is associated with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Microinjections of orexin into the brain or optogenetic stimulation of orexin neurons increase waking. Orexin neurons are active in waking and quiescent in sleep, which is consistent with their role in promoting waking. On the other hand, the MCH neurons are quiet in waking but active in sleep, suggesting that they could initiate sleep. Recently, for the first time the MCH neurons were stimulated optogenetically and it increased sleep. Indeed, optogenetic activation of MCH neurons induced sleep in both mice and rats at a circadian time when they should be awake, indicating the powerful effect that MCH neurons have in suppressing the wake-promoting effect of not only orexin but also of all of the other arousal neurotransmitters.

Each is a separate and distinct neuronal population, but they project to similar target areas in the brain. Orexin has been implicated in regulating arousal since loss of orexin neurons is associated with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Microinjections of orexin into the brain or optogenetic stimulation of orexin neurons increase waking. Orexin neurons are active in waking and quiescent in sleep, which is consistent with their role in promoting waking. On the other hand, the MCH neurons are quiet in waking but active in sleep, suggesting that they could initiate sleep. Recently, for the first time the MCH neurons were stimulated optogenetically and it increased sleep. Indeed, optogenetic activation of MCH neurons induced sleep in both mice and rats at a circadian time when they should be awake, indicating the powerful effect that MCH neurons have in suppressing the wake-promoting effect of not only orexin but also of all of the other arousal neurotransmitters. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is coexpressed with MCH in the MCH neurons, although MCH is also inhibitory. The inhibitory tone of the MCH neurons is opposite to the excitatory tone of the orexin neurons.

It is caused by the loss of ~70,000 posterior hypothalamic neurons that produce the wake-promoting neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT) (orexin). We identified two DQ0602-binding HCRT epitopes, HCRT56-68 and HCRT87-99, that activated a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells in narcolepsy patients but not in DQ0602-positive healthy control subjects. Because of the established association of narcolepsy with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A strain (pH1N1), we administered a seasonal influenza vaccine (containing pH1N1) to patients with narcolepsy and found an increased frequency of circulating HCRT56-68- and HCRT87-99-reactive T cells.

It is caused by the loss of ~70,000 posterior hypothalamic neurons that produce the wake-promoting neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT) (orexin). We identified two DQ0602-binding HCRT epitopes, HCRT56-68 and HCRT87-99, that activated a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells in narcolepsy patients but not in DQ0602-positive healthy control subjects. Because of the established association of narcolepsy with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A strain (pH1N1), we administered a seasonal influenza vaccine (containing pH1N1) to patients with narcolepsy and found an increased frequency of circulating HCRT56-68- and HCRT87-99-reactive T cells.

The disease is considered to be the result of the selective disruption of neuronal cells in the lateral hypothalamus expressing the neuropeptide hypocretin, which controls the sleep-wake cycle.

The disease is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and other abnormal manifestations of REM sleep, such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. Recently, it was discovered that the pathophysiology of (idiopathic) narcolepsy-cataplexy is linked to hypocretin ligand deficiency in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as the positivity of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR2/DQ6 (DQB1*0602). The symptoms of narcolepsy can also occur during the course of other neurological conditions (i.e. symptomatic narcolepsy). We define symptomatic narcolepsy as those cases that meet the International Sleep Disorders Narcolepsy Criteria, and which are also associated with a significant underlying neurological disorder that accounts for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and temporal associations. To date, we have counted 116 symptomatic cases of narcolepsy reported in literature. As, several authors previously reported, inherited disorders (n=38), tumors (n=33), and head trauma (n=19) are the three most frequent causes for symptomatic narcolepsy. Of the 116 cases, 10 are associated with multiple sclerosis, one case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and relatively rare cases were reported with vascular disorders (n=6), encephalitis (n=4) and degeneration (n=1), and hererodegenerative disorder (three cases in a family). EDS without cataplexy or any REM sleep abnormalities is also often associated with these neurological conditions, and defined as symptomatic cases of EDS. Although it is difficult to rule out the comorbidity of idiopathic narcolepsy in some cases, review of the literature reveals numerous unquestionable cases of symptomatic narcolepsy. These include cases with HLA negative and/or late onset, and cases in which the occurrences of the narcoleptic symptoms are parallel with the rise and fall of the causative disease. A review of these cases (especially those with brain tumors), illustrates a clear picture that the hypothalamus is most often involved. Several cases of symptomatic cataplexy (without EDS) were also reported and in contrast, these cases appear to be often associated with non-hypothalamic structures. CSF hypocretin-1 measurement were also carried out in a limited number of symptomatic cases of narcolepsy/EDS, including narcolepsy/EDS associated with tumors (n=5), head trauma (n=3), vascular disorders (n=5), encephalopathies (n=3), degeneration (n=30), demyelinating disorder (n=7), genetic/congenital disorders (n=11) and others (n=2). Reduced CSF hypocretin-1 levels were seen in most symptomatic narcolepsy cases of EDS with various etiologies and EDS in these cases is sometimes reversible with an improvement of the causative neurological disorder and an improvement of the hypocretin status. It is also noted that some symptomatic EDS cases (with Parkinson diseases and the thalamic infarction) appeared, but they are not linked with hypocretin ligand deficiency. In contrast to idiopathic narcolepsy cases, an occurrence of cataplexy is not tightly associated with hypocretin ligand deficiency in symptomatic cases. Since CSF hypocretin measures are still experimental, cases with sleep abnormalities/cataplexy are habitually selected for CSF hypocretin measures.

Methylphenidate treatment was effective in improving daytime sleepiness in NT1 patients with ADHD (PSQ, 16.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 vs 13.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9, p\u0026lt;0.05) but was ineffective on ADHD symptoms (ADHD-RS, 25.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.1 vs 26.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.9, p\u0026gt;0.05).\n\nA high prevalence of ADHD (28.8%) was identified in children and adolescents with NT1. Comorbid ADHD symptoms were associated with increased levels of mood disorders and lower quality of life.
