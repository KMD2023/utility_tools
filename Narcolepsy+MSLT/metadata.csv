40156721,Spectral and Microstate EEG Analysis in Narcolepsy Type 1 and Type 2 Across Sleep Stages.,Liang S; Cheng Y; Du S; Paudel D; Xu Y; Zhang B,2025 Mar 29,Brain topography,"The primary distinction between narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) is the presence or absence of cataplexy, which is commonly determined through clinical interviews, though it can be prone to error due to vague patients descriptions.

This study aimed to investigate EEG microstate differences between NT1 and NT2 and their correlation with clinical assessments.

Polysomnography (PSG) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) were performed on 14 NT1 and 13 NT2 patients from three hospitals, with data from the ISRUC-SLEEP dataset serving as the comparison group. After EEG preprocessing, we performed the spectral analysis in NT1 and NT2, followed by microstate analysis. Grand mean maps were used for backfitting to obtain microstate parameters. Then, Spearman correlation was performed between the microstate parameters and the ESS and MSLT parameters.

We found that the relative delta power in N2 was lower in the NT1 group compared to the NT2 group. Four microstates were clustered in all groups, and no statistical differences were observed in the microstate parameters between NT1 and NT2 groups. In the NT1 group, microstate D during wakefulness showed a positive correlation with ESS, while in the NT2 group, microstate D during wakefulness showed a negative correlation with ESS.

There are spectral differences between the NT1 and NT2 groups, and the opposite correlation between microstate D and ESS during wakefulness in NT1 and NT2 suggest that the underlying mechanisms leading to excessive daytime sleepiness in the two groups may be different.",2025.0
40139811,[Symptomatic narcolepsy type 2 in a patient with AQP4-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder].,Yoshimura T; Wakai M; Kanbayashi T; Katsuno M,2025 Apr 25,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,"A 63-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and treated with IFNβ-1b, developed asymptomatic lesion expansion surrounding the thalamus and basal ganglia. However, an AQP4 autoantibody ELISA was negative. The patient was subsequently hospitalized due to drowsiness, lethargy, and difficulty in managing housework. During lumbar puncture, the patient lost consciousness. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed rapid eye movements, and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) indicated narcolepsy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin levels were normal, and no cataplexy was observed. The patient was thus diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2. The patient tested positive for AQP4 antibody, and was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Sleep physiology testing is crucial because some patients with NMOSD do not exhibit hypothalamic lesions or decreased CSF orexin levels.",2025.0
40080737,Use of Portable 24-Hour Polysomnography as Alternative Diagnostic Tool for Narcolepsy Type 1 in Adults and Children.,Biscarini F; Vandi S; Zenesini C; Vignatelli L; Citeroni F; Antelmi E; Franceschini C; Barateau L; Dauvilliers Y; Mignot E; Plazzi G; Pizza F,2025 Apr 8,Neurology,"The diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) currently requires the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), or a nocturnal sleep-onset REM period (SOREMP) combined with typical cataplexy, or alternatively the determination of CSF hypocretin-1 (CSF-hcrt-1) deficiency. We evaluated the 24-hour polysomnography (PSG) recordings in adult and pediatric patients as an alternative diagnostic tool.

Patients of any age, referred to the narcolepsy center of a university hospital for suspected central disorder of hypersomnolence (CDH), were consecutively recruited between 2013 and 2022. Participants underwent 2 days (day1-night1-day2-night2) of continuous dynamic PSG followed by MSLT. When consent was given, CSF-hcrt-1 was measured. The accuracy of 24-hour PSG variables from night1 and day2 (index test) was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in identifying NT1 based on current criteria (applied to night2-PSG, MSLT, and CSF-hcrt1). The markers with area under the curve (AUC) ≥0.75 were then tested in adults and children, separately, and to diagnose NT1 and narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) in different scenarios.

Eight hundred seven patients (30.1% pediatric, 52.4% male) were included, and 709 had CSF-hcrt-1 measured. According to the standard criteria, 322 were diagnosed with NT1 (mean age 26.7 ± 17.1 years, 40.4% pediatric, 54.0% male) and 484 with non-NT1 (mean age 32.7 ± 16.5 years, 23.3% pediatric, 51.3% male), encompassing 31 with NT2, 163 with idiopathic hypersomnia, and 281 with other diagnoses. Detecting SOREMP ≥1 during daytime resulted in AUC = 0.84 (95% CI 0.82-0.87), with 84.4% sensitivity and 84.5% specificity for NT1. Performance was superior to all nighttime-PSG measures (p < 0.001) including nighttime-SOREMP (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI 0.74-0.80; sensitivity = 62.1%, specificity = 91.7%) and did not differ from 24-hour SOREMP ≥1 (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI 0.82-0.87; sensitivity = 89.7%, specificity = 80.2%). The combination of daytime-SOREMP ≥1 with cataplexy showed AUC = 0.89 (95% CI 0.86-0.91) for NT1, superior to the combination of nighttime-SOREMP with cataplexy (AUC = 0.78, 95% CI 0.76-0.81, p < 0.001) and similar to MSLT criteria for narcolepsy (AUC = 0.90, 95% CI 0.88-0.92, p = 0.36). Performances were similar in adults and children. Daytime-SOREMP ≥1 identified NT1 and NT2 combined within all CDH with a sensitivity of 80.8% and specificity of 88.0%.

The detection of daytime-SOREMP during dynamic 24-hour PSG is more accurate than nighttime-SOREMP for diagnosing narcolepsy and, combined with cataplexy, is comparable with MSLT criteria for the identification of NT1. These results offer the prospect of 24-hour PSG diagnostics for NT1 in the home setting.

This study provides Class II evidence that daytime SOREMP during a 24-hour PSG accurately distinguishes NT1 in patients with a clinical history of possible cataplexy from those who do not have NT1.",2025.0
39951174,Pons metabolite alterations in narcolepsy type 1.,Mitolo M; Pizza F; Manners DN; Guidi L; Venneri A; Morandi L; Tonon C; Plazzi G; Lodi R,2025 Apr,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,"Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a rare central sleep disorder characterized by a selective loss of hypocretin/orexin (hcrt)-producing neurons in the postero-lateral hypothalamus that project to widespread areas of the brain and brainstem. The aim of this study was to explore in a group of NT1 patients the metabolic alterations in the pons and their associations with disease features.

Twenty-one NT1 patients (16 M) and twenty age-matched healthy controls (10 M) underwent a brain 1H MRS on a 1.5 T GE Medical Systems scanner. Metabolite content of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and myo-inositol (mI) were estimated relative to creatine (Cr), using LCModel 6.3. Clinical data were also collected with validated questionnaires, polysomnography, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 (CSF hcrt-1) concentration and genetic markers.

NT1 patients compared with healthy controls showed lower NAA/Cr ratio (p = 0.007) and NAA/mI ratio (p = 0.011) in the pons. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score showed a significant negative correlation with NAA/Cr content (p = 0.023), MSLT sleep latency a negative correlation with the mI/Cr ratio (p = 0.008), and sleep onset REM periods a positive correlation with the mI/Cr ratio (p = 0.027). CSF hcrt-1 levels were positively correlated with the NAA/Cr ratio (p = 0.039) and negatively with the mI/Cr ratio (p = 0.045) and the Cho/Cr ratio (p = 0.026).

The metabolic alterations found in the pons of NT1 patients using the MR Spectroscopy technique were associated with subjective and objective disease severity measures, highlighting the crucial role of this biomarker in the pathophysiology of the disease.",2025.0
39729629,Ofatumumab treatment in new-onset narcolepsy type 1 following SARS-CoV-2 infection.,Wang X; Zhang X; Yuan N; Liu Y,2025 Mar,Annals of clinical and translational neurology,"To explore the efficacy of ofatumumab in new onset narcolepsy type 1 following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We present a 9-year-old girl who experienced new onset narcolepsy type 1 following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Polysomnography (PSG) followed by a daytime multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was under taken after admission. A lumbar puncture was performed to evaluate the CSF orexin-A level. We assessed the CSF hypocretin-1 concentration utilizing the RIA kit from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. HLA typing was performed. Furthermore, we treated the patient with subcutaneous injections of ofatumumab, and followed her for nearly six-month. The CSF orexin-A level, CD19+ and total B cell population were measured before and after treatment.

The girl had experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection 4 months before presentation. After that, she started to experience excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. She also began to experience nightmares and violent behaviors during her nocturnal sleep, which were not present before her SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the same time, she developed obesity and exhibited psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, and aggression. MSLT showed a mean sleep latency of 2.7 min, and 5 times sleep onset REM periods. The CSF orexin-A level was pathologically low at 34.06 pg/mL, and she tested positive for HLA-DQB1*06:02. Consequently, a diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 was confirmed. Before and after treatment with subcutaneous injections of ofatumumab, the CD19+ and total B cell population before treatment and after 1 months showed a significant reduction from 11% and 296 cells per microliter to 0.56% and 11 cells per microliter, respectively. Within a week following ofatumumab therapy, there was a marked improvement in both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Notably, her cataplexy was almost entirely resolved following ofatumumab therapy. Her condition remained stable throughout the 9-month follow-up period. She could normally attend school.

The efficacy of ofatumumab in this case provides additional support for an autoimmune etiology in narcolepsy with cataplexy, highlighting the potential involvement of B-cells in its pathophysiology. This understanding will aid in the development of specific immunotherapeutic strategies for early implementation upon disease onset.",2025.0
39571509,Distinguishing between children referred for assessment of excessive daytime sleepiness using polysomnographic measures.,Lee WLJ; Wong OYJ; Shetty M; Plunkett G; Walter LM; Davey MJ; Nixon GM; Horne RS,2024 Dec,Sleep medicine,"Currently, diagnosing narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in subjectively sleepy children requires an overnight polysomnographic sleep study followed by a daytime multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). We aimed to compare sleep macro-architecture to identify differences between these groups.

All children referred for a MSLT between May 2010 to December 2023 whose parent consented for their data be used in research were eligible. Each child was age- and sex-matched to a control. Sleep stability was defined as the maintenance of a particular sleep stage before waking or transitioning to another sleep state. As a measure of sleep disturbance, the number and duration of bouts of each sleep stage was recorded.

28 children with Narcolepsy, 11 with IH and 26 with subjective sleepiness were included. Children with narcolepsy exhibited higher numbers of transitions to wake after sleep onset compared to their controls and to the subjectively sleepy group (p < 0.001 for both). The number of REM bouts was greater in the narcolepsy group compared to their control group (p < 0.001), the IH group (p < 0.05) and the subjectively sleepy group (p < 0.05), while the average duration of REM bouts was shorter in the narcolepsy group compared to both the IH group (p < 0.05) and subjectively sleepy group (p < 0.05). Mean sleep latency on the MSLT was correlated with a number of polysomnographic variables.

Our study suggests that specific sleep architecture patterns could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers for distinguishing paediatric narcolepsy from those with IH and those with a non-diagnostic MSLT.",2024.0
39533540,Sleep schedules and MSLT-based diagnosis of narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia: Exploring potential associations in a large clinical sample.,Matsui K; Usui A; Takei Y; Kuriyama K; Inoue Y,2025 Jun,Journal of sleep research,"Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia relies on the frequency of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods observed on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. This study investigated whether variations in sleep schedules, particularly delayed sleep-wake patterns, contribute to the diagnostic distinction between narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia. The study included 871 patients aged 18-39 years (316 with narcolepsy type 2, 555 with idiopathic hypersomnia). These patients were diagnosed based on MSLT results following polysomnography from November 2013 to November 2017. Patients' sleep habits, including bedtime and wake-up times on weekdays and weekends during the 2 weeks preceding the polysomnography/Multiple Sleep Latency Test, were assessed using self-reported sleep logs. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with narcolepsy type 2 diagnosis. The analysis revealed that being male (p < 0.001), younger age (p < 0.001), shorter weekday sleep duration (p < 0.05), and a delayed weekday sleep midpoint time (p < 0.01) were significantly associated with a diagnosis of narcolepsy type 2. The study suggests that the conventionally fixed schedule of polysomnography and Multiple Sleep Latency Test administration may have contributed to the increased occurrence of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods particularly in individuals with a delayed sleep-wake schedule.",2025.0
39392922,Probabilistic sleep staging in MSLTs across hypersomnia disorders.,Hjuler Andersen L; Brink-Kjaer A; Sum-Ping O; Pizza F; Biscarini F; Haubjerg Østerby NC; Mignot E; Plazzi G; Jennum PJ,2025 Feb 10,Sleep,"This study aimed to identify novel markers of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) using between-nap opportunity periods (""lights on"") and in-nap opportunity periods (""lights off"") features of Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) recordings. We hypothesized that NT1 could be identified both from sleep-wake instability and patterns of sleepiness during wakefulness. Further, we explored if MSLTs from NT1 and narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) patients could be distinguished despite having the same diagnostic thresholds.

We analyzed ""lights on"" and ""lights off"" periods of the MSLT, extracting 163 features describing sleepiness, microsleep, and sleep stage mixing using data from 177 patients with NT1, NT2, idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), and subjective hypersomnia (sH) from three sleep centers. These features were based on automated probabilistic sleep staging, also denoted as hypnodensities, using U-Sleep. Hypersomnias were differentiated using either or both features from ""lights on"" and ""lights off.""

Patients with NT1 could be distinguished from NT2, IH, and sH using features solely from ""lights on"" periods with a sensitivity of 0.76 and specificity of 0.71. When using features from all periods of the MSLT, NT1 was distinguished from NT2 alone with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.84.

The findings of this study demonstrate microsleeps and sleep stage mixing as potential markers of sleep attacks and unstable sleep-wake states common in NT1. Further, NT1 and NT2 could be frequently distinguished using ""lights off"" features.",2025.0
39226768,CSF-profile and hypocretin levels in children with narcolepsy type 1 and 2.,Josler M; El Naggar I; Bertolini A; Kutz P; Roll C; Wendel EM; Schlüter B; Hahn A; Siegert S; Hackenberg A; Zuberi SM; Otto M; Rostásy K,2024 Nov,European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society,"Narcolepsy is a rare neurological disease caused by dysfunction of hypocretin-producing neurons. Hypocretin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of less than 110 pg/ml are considered pathological in adults.

To compare hypocretin levels of children with narcolepsy type 1, type 2 and disease control groups, in addition to a detailed CSF analysis, clinical and polysomnographic parameters.

In a retrospective, cross-sectional study, children diagnosed with narcolepsy based on clinical and polysomnographic parameters, who received a CSF analysis and hypocretin measurement, in addition to controls, were included. CSF was analyzed for the presence of cells, total protein, lactate, intrathecal synthesis of antibodies against measles, rubella and/or varicella zoster, and oligoclonal bands. All children had a complete sleep study including a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).

49 children with narcolepsy type 1, 15 children with type 2 and 37 children with other (suspected) neurological diseases were included. CSF routine analysis did not reveal any differences between the three groups. All children with narcolepsy type 1 had hypocretin levels of less than 110 pg/ml (range: 10-101 pg/ml). Hypocretin levels in type 2 patients ranged from 43 to 436 pg/ml (median 157 pg/ml). The median hypocretin level in the control cohort was 365 pg/ml (range: 153-583 pg/ml). In 4 children with narcolepsy type 2 the diagnosis was changed to narcolepsy level 1 because of a CSF hypocretin level of less than 110 pg/ml according to the recently proposed criteria, which consider the measurement of hypocretin in CSF.

Children with narcolepsy type 1 showed significantly lower CSF hypocretin levels than children with narcolepsy type 2 and controls. As suggested by the recently published narcolepsy criteria, hypocretin levels of less than 110 pg/ml should be used as an additional criterion for the presence of narcolepsy type 1 in children.",2024.0
39226673,Clinical features and mechanisms of neck myoclonus in narcolepsy.,Xu W; Zhang X; Zhang B; Lu S; Huang W; Xu J; Liu Y; Zhao W; Yan Z; Yu Y; Qiu S; Wu B; Tang J,2024 Nov,Sleep medicine,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of neck myoclonus (NM) on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy (NT) and to further explore possible underlying mechanisms.

We included 72 patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), 34 patients with narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) and 33 healthy controls. Patients underwent questionnaires, lumbar puncture procedure, polysomnography, and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Healthy controls underwent polysomnography and questionnaires. Orexin-A levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Three catecholamines, including dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, in the CSF were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).

Both the NT1 and NT2 groups displayed a higher level of NM incidence rate and index compared to the control group in PSG. NT1 displayed greater MSLT REM--NM incidence rate and index than NT2. NM were often associated with arousal or awakening and body movements, which had a prominent influence on sleep quality in both narcoleptic patients and controls. There was a positive correlation between the NM index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS) scores in NT1 patients. In MSLT of NT1 patients, REM-NM index were positively correlated with the CSF dopamine levels, and there were elevated dopamine levels but reduced orexin-A levels in patients with REM-NM.

NM incidence rate and index were high in patients with narcolepsy, which had a huge effect on sleep quality and aggravated daytime sleepiness. NM should be considered pathological and viewed as a new sleep-related movement disorder. Orexin-A and dopamine may be involved in the development of NM.",2024.0
39154204,The actigraphic evaluation of daytime sleep in central disorders of hypersomnolence: comparison with polysomnography.,Biscarini F; Vandi S; Riccio C; Raggini L; Neccia G; Plazzi G; Pizza F,2024 Dec 11,Sleep,"The role of actigraphy in central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH) is expanding but evidence of reliability with polysomnography (PSG) is scarce and provided only during nighttime. We explored the agreement between actigraphy and continuous 24-hour PSG at CDH diagnosis.

Forty-four consecutive drug-naïve patients (28 narcolepsy and 16 idiopathic hypersomnia [IH]) underwent actigraphy during 24 hours of free-running PSG, during multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and 13 of them also during maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT). Daytime and nighttime sleep features and MSLT and MWT mean sleep latencies (mSL) were estimated with the actigraphic algorithms by Cole-Kripke (CK), Sadeh (Sad), and University of California San Diego (UCSD). Agreement to corresponding PSG measures was assessed with Bland-Altman plots.

Nighttime-total sleep time (TST) in narcolepsy was significantly underestimated with CK (bias 27.8 minutes, 95% CI 13.7 to 41.9) and Sad (bias 56.7 minutes, 95% CI 38.8/74.5). Daytime-TST was overestimated in IH and narcolepsy with all algorithms (CK: bias -42.2, 95% CI -67/-17.4; Sad: bias -30.2 minutes, 95% CI -52.7/-7.7; UCSD bias -86.9 minutes, 95% CI -118.2/-55.6). 24-hour-TST was overestimated by CK and UCSD in IH (CK: bias -58.5 minutes, 95% CI -105.5/-11.5; UCSD: bias -118.8 minutes, 95% CI -172.5/-65), and by UCSD in narcolepsy (bias -68.8 minutes, 95% CI -109.3/-38.2). In the entire cohort, actigraphy overestimated MSLT mSL but not MWT mSL.

Conventional actigraphic algorithms overestimate 24-hour TST in IH and underestimate nighttime TST in narcolepsy. These discrepancies call for the cautious application of actigraphy in the diagnostic process of CDH and the development of new quantitative signal analysis approaches.",2024.0
39147593,Autonomic cardiovascular control is unaffected in children referred for assessment of excessive daytime sleepiness.,Francis J; Plunkett G; Shetty M; Davey MJ; Nixon GM; Walter LM; Horne RSC,2025 Feb,Journal of sleep research,"There is conflicting evidence for impaired autonomic control of heart rate (HR) in adults with narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnolence (IH). Despite these chronic hypersomnia conditions primarily being diagnosed around the age of puberty, there are limited studies in children. The present study investigated cardiovascular control using heart rate variability (HRV) and the extent of nocturnal HR dipping during sleep in children and adolescents with narcolepsy and IH. Children having an overnight polysomnographic study followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) for investigation of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) between May 2010 to December 2023 were included: 28 children diagnosed with narcolepsy, 11 with IH, and 26 subjectively sleepy children who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for either narcolepsy or IH. Each clinically referred child was matched for age and sex with a control. Time domain and frequency domain HRV were calculated from ECG recorded at 512 Hz. There were no differences in either time domain or spectral analysis of HRV between clinical groups or between clinical groups and their control group. The expected sleep state differences in HRV were observed in all groups. There was also no difference in HR nocturnal dipping between groups. Despite evidence for abnormal autonomic function in adults with narcolepsy and IH, our study did not identify any abnormalities in HR, HR control, or nocturnal dipping of HR in children referred for assessment of EDS. This suggests that autonomic dysfunction may be a feature of these conditions that develops in later life.",2025.0
38286043,Is there a role for repeating the multiple sleep latency test across childhood when initially non-diagnostic?,Nisbet LC; Nixon GM; Anantharajah A; Davey MJ,2024 Mar,Sleep medicine,"The gold standard investigation for central disorders of hypersomnolence is the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). As the clinical features of these disorders of hypersomnolence evolve with time in children, clinicians may consider repeating a previously non-diagnostic MSLT. Currently there are no guidelines available regards the utility and timing of repeating paediatric MSLTs.

Retrospective review of children aged 3-18years with ≥2MSLTs between 2005 and 2022. Narcolepsy was defined as mean sleep latency (MSL) <8min with ≥2 sleep onset REM (SOREM); idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) was defined as MSL <8min with <2 SOREM. MSLTs not meeting these criteria were labelled non-diagnostic.

19 children (9 female) with initial non-diagnostic MSLT underwent repeat MSLT, with 6 proceeding to a 3rd MSLT following 2 non-diagnostic MSLTs. The 2nd MSLT resulted in diagnosis in 6/19 (32 %) (3 narcolepsy, 3 IH); and 2/6 (33 %) 3rd MSLT were diagnostic (2 IH). Median age at initial MSLT was 7.5y (range 3.4-17.8y), with repeat performed after median of 2.9y (range 0.9-8.2y), and 3rd after a further 1.9 years (range 1.2-4.2y). Mean change in MSL on repeat testing was -2min (range -15.5min to +4.9min, p = 0.18). Of the 8 diagnostic repeat MSLTs, in addition to the MSL falling below 8 min, 2 children also developed ≥2 SOREM that had not been previously present.

A third of repeat MSLTs became diagnostic, suggesting repeat MSLT should be considered in childhood if clinical suspicion persists. Further work needs to address the ideal interval between MSLTs and diagnostic cut-points specific to the paediatric population.",2024.0
38244465,Sleepy Kids: are the current diagnostic criteria for multiple sleep latency tests enough?,Anantharajah A; Davey MJ; Nixon GM,2024 Feb,Sleep medicine,"Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common in childhood and is currently quantified using adult criteria on a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). This study aimed to describe paediatric MSLT results, particularly focussing on a previously proposed alternative mean sleep latency (MSL) threshold for children of 12 min, and assess the impact of a 5th nap. We performed a retrospective analysis of MSLTs at a single paediatric centre from 2004 to 2021. Narcolepsy was defined as a mean sleep latency (MSL) ≤8min with ≥2 sleep onset REM (SOREM) periods. Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH) was defined as a MSL ≤8min with <2 SOREMs. An ambiguous MSLT result was defined as a MSL 8-12min and/or ≥2 SOREM periods. Of 214 MSLTs [50 % female, median age 14.0y (range 3.3-20.1y)], narcolepsy was diagnosed in 48 (22 %), IH in 22 (10 %) and the result was ambiguous in 44 (21 %). Those with ambiguous MSLT results were older (15.6 vs 13.4y, p = 0.006) with a higher proportion of females (61 % vs 35 %, p = 0.01) in comparison to the narcolepsy group. A 5th nap was performed in 60 (28 %) of MSLTs and only changed the outcome in one case. In conclusion, MSLT results are borderline in 21 % of paediatric cases, suggesting that current adult diagnostic criteria may miss narcolepsy and IH in children. A 5th nap usually makes no difference or increases the MSL, suggesting that a four nap MSLT protocol could be used apart from rare cases where the result is borderline after the 4th nap.",2024.0
38165365,Role of Daytime Continuous Polysomnography in the Diagnosis of Pediatric Narcolepsy Type 1.,Pizza F; Vignatelli L; Vandi S; Zenesini C; Biscarini F; Franceschini C; Antelmi E; Ingravallo F; Mignot E; Bruni O; Nobili L; Veggiotti P; Ferri R; Plazzi G,2024 Jan 9,Neurology,"Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is still largely underdiagnosed or diagnosed too late in children. Difficulties in obtaining rapid and reliable diagnostic evaluations of the condition in clinical practice partially explain this problem. Predictors of NT1 include cataplexy and sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs), documented during nocturnal polysomnography (N-PSG) or through the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), although low CSF hypocretin-1 (CSF hcrt-1) is the definitive biological disease marker. Obtaining reliable MSLT results is not always feasible in children; therefore, this study aimed to validate daytime continuous polysomnography (D-PSG) as an alternative diagnostic tool.

Two hundred consecutive patients aged younger than 18 years (112 with NT1; 25 with other hypersomnias, including narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia; and 63 with subjective excessive daytime sleepiness) were randomly split into 2 groups: group 1 (n = 133) for the identification of diagnostic markers and group 2 (n = 67) for the validation of the detected markers. The D-PSG data collected included the number of spontaneous naps, total sleep time, and the number of daytime SOREMPs (d-SOREMP). D-PSG data were tested against CSF hcrt-1 deficiency (NT1 diagnosis) as the gold standard using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in group 1. ROC diagnostic performances of single and combined D-PSG parameters were tested in group 1 and validated in group 2.

In group 1, the areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were 0.91 (95% CI 0.86-0.96) for d-SOREMPs, 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.89) for the number of spontaneous naps, and 0.70 (95% CI 0.60-0.79) for total sleep time. A d-SOREMP count ≥1 (sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 72%), coupled with a diurnal total sleep time above 60 minutes (sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 91%), identified NT1 in group 1 with high reliability (area under the ROC curve of 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.97). These results were confirmed in the validation group with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.79-0.97).

D-PSG recording is an easily performed, cost-effective, and reliable tool for identifying NT1 in children. Further studies should confirm its validity with home D-PSG monitoring. These alternative procedures could be used to confirm NT1 diagnosis and curtail diagnostic delay.",2024.0
37862255,[Assessments of sleepiness in adolescents: A key tool for better intervene in mental health].,Touchette E; Servot S; Davidson-Urbain W; Pennestri MH; Godbout R; Montplaisir J,2023 Spring,Sante mentale au Quebec,"Objectives Daytime sleepiness in adolescents has negative impacts on physical, cognitive, and emotional health, with direct or indirect consequences on their mental health. This review aims to describe specialized tools assessing daytime sleepiness in adolescents so that mental health professionals can screen for a variety of sleep disorders, from the rarest ones, such as narcolepsy, to the most common ones, such as sleep-wake cycle delay in adolescents. Method Articles were selected in Medline (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and targeted adolescents aged between 13 and 18 or the keyword ""adolescent*"". The keywords used were: ""sleepiness test"" AND ""questionnaire*"". Only articles in French or English and published until January 9, 2023 were included. A total of 277 scientific articles were screened. Final sample included a total of 35 articles describing sleepiness measurement tools in adolescents. Results Among the 35 articles, a total of seven daytime sleepiness measurement tools in adolescents were identified. Four of them were subjective: 1) the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents (ESS-CHAD), 2) the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS), 3) the Cleveland Adolescent Sleepiness Questionnaire (CASQ) and 4) the French Sleepiness Scale for Adolescents (FSSA). These self-reported questionnaires are less expensive and they can be used easily by mental health professionals as opposed to objective tools. Three objective tools have been identified: 1) the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), 2) the maintenance of wakefulness test or called the ""Maintenance Wakefulness Test"" (MWT) and 3) the pupillographic sleepiness test (PST). Conclusion Given that adolescents end-of the-day sleep pressure, often resulting in a greater opportunity to light exposure, they are more at risk for daytime sleepiness and consequently to mental health challenges. Mental health professionals should therefore systematically screen for daytime sleepiness in adolescents using subjective tools. There are reliable and validated tools that are translated into French, such as the FSSA and the ESS-CHAD to measure daytime sleepiness in adolescents and lifestyles problems associated with sleep loss When daytime sleepiness suggests the presence of medical-based sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy, restless sleep disorders or sleep apnea, it is important to pursue an investigation with objective tools (nocturnal polysomnography, MLST and MWT) in collaboration with the adolescent's physician.",2023.0
37544279,Repeated polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test in narcolepsy type 1 and other hypersomnolence disorders.,Torstensen EW; Haubjerg Østerby NC; Kornum BR; Wanscher B; Mignot E; Barløse M; Jennum PJ,2023 Oct,Sleep medicine,"The diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on clinical information, combined with polysomnography (PSG) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). PSG and the MSLT are moderately reliable at diagnosing narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) but unreliable for diagnosing narcolepsy type 2 (NT2). This is a problem, especially given the increased risk of a false-positive MSLT in the context of circadian misalignment or sleep deprivation, both of which commonly occur in the general population.

We aimed to clarify the accuracy of PSG/MSLT testing in diagnosing NT1 versus controls without sleep disorders. Repeatability and reliability of PSG/MSLT testing and temporal changes in clinical findings of patients with NT1 versus patients with hypersomnolence with normal hypocretin-1 were compared.

84 patients with NT1 and 100 patients with non-NT1-hypersomnolence disorders, all with congruent cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 (CSF-hcrt-1) levels, were included. Twenty-five of the 84 NT1 patients and all the hypersomnolence disorder patients underwent a follow-up evaluation consisting of clinical assessment, PSG, and a modified MSLT. An additional 68 controls with no sleep disorders were assessed at baseline.

Confirming results from previous studies, we found that PSG and our modified MSLT accurately and reliably diagnosed hypocretin-deficient NT1 (accuracy = 0.88, reliability = 0.80). Patients with NT1 had stable clinical and electrophysiological presentations over time that suggested a stable phenotype. In contrast, the PSG/MSLT results of patients with hypersomnolence, and normal CSF-hcrt-1 had poor reliability (0.32) and low repeatability.",2023.0
37499464,How reliable is a simplified MSLT nap termination protocol?,Siegenthaler P; Valko PO; Renzel R; Werth E; Poryazova R; Baumann CR; Büchele F,2023 Sep,Sleep medicine,"According to current practical guidelines, naps of the Mean Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) must be terminated 15 min after sleep onset, which requires ad hoc scoring. For clinical convenience, some sleep clinics use a simplified protocol with fixed nap lengths of 20min. Its diagnostic accuracy remains unknown.

A subset of MSLT naps of 56 narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), 98 Parkinson's disease (PD), 117 sleep disordered breathing (SDB), 22 insufficient sleep syndrome (ISS) patients, and 24 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), originally performed according to the simplified protocol, were retrospectively adjusted to standard protocol (nap termination 15min after sleep onset or after 20min when no sleep occurs). This was feasible in 60% of MSLT naps; in this subset, we compared sensitivity and specificity of both MSLT protocols for identification of patients with and without NT1.

Sensitivity of classical MSLT criteria for NT1, i.e. mean sleep latency ≤8.0min and ≥2 sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs), did not differ between protocols (95%). Specificity, however, was slightly lower (88.1% vs. 89.7%) in the simplified nap termination protocol, with 3 SDB patients and 1 ISS patient having false-positive MSLT findings in the simplified but not in the standard protocol.

The use of a simplified MSLT protocol with fixed nap duration had no impact on MSLT sensitivity for NT1, but the longer sleep periods in the simplified protocol increased the likelihood of REM sleep occurrence particularly in non-NT1 conditions, resulting in a slightly lower MSLT specificity compared to the standard protocol.",2023.0

They are, however, not mandatory for the diagnosis, and their pathophysiological nature is not understood. This study aimed at verifying whether IH patients with and without unrefreshing naps constitute two subtypes of IH based on their demographic/clinical characteristics, and sleep architecture.

One hundred twelve IH patients underwent a polysomnography (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). They completed questionnaires on excessive daytime sleepiness, mood, and sleep quality. They were met by sleep medicine physicians who conducted a semi-structured clinical interview and questioned them on refreshing aspects of their naps. Patients who reported unrefreshing naps were compared to patients reporting refreshing naps on questionnaires, MSLT and PSG variables, with age as a covariable. As sensitivity analyses, we performed the same comparisons in participants presenting objective markers of IH and those diagnosed with IH based only on clinical judgment (subjective IH), separately.

In the whole sample, 61% of patients reported unrefreshing naps. These participants had less awakenings, a lower percentage of N1 sleep, less sleep stage transitions, and a higher percentage of REM sleep on the nighttime PSG compared to the refreshing naps subgroup. When subjective and objective IH patients were tested separately, more group differences were observed on PSG for subjective IH patients.

Patients with unrefreshing naps have less fragmented sleep compared to those with refreshing naps. Future studies should investigate whether this group difference indicates a weaker arousal drive.",2023.0
37348285,Applicability of the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) in hypersomnolence: Experience and results from a tertiary referral center.,van der Hoeven AE; Bijlenga D; Bouhuijs P; van Schie MKM; Lammers GJ; Fronczek R,2023 Aug,Sleep medicine,"Evaluation of hypersomnolence disorders ideally includes an assessment of vigilance using the short Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). We evaluated whether this task can differentiate between hypersomnolence disorders, whether it correlates with subjective and objective sleepiness, whether it is affected by the time of day, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.

We analyzed diagnostic data of 306 individuals with hypersomnolence complaints diagnosed with narcolepsy type 1 (n=100), narcolepsy type 2 (n=20), idiopathic hypersomnia (n=49), obstructive sleep apnea (n=27) and other causes or without explanatory diagnosis (n=110). We included the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), polysomnography, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and SART, which were administered five times during the day (outcomes: reaction time, total, commission and omission errors).

The SART outcomes did not differ between groups when adjusted for relevant covariates. Higher ESS scores were associated with longer reaction times and more commission errors (p<.01). The main outcome, total errors, did not differ between times of the day. Reaction times and omission errors were impacted (p<.05).

The SART quantifies disturbed vigilance, an important dimension of disorders of hypersomnolence. Results do not suggest that depressive symptoms influence SART outcomes. A practice session is advised. Testing time should be taken into account when interpreting results. We conclude that the SART does not differentiate between central disorders of hypersomnolence. It may be a helpful addition to the standard diagnostic workup and monitoring of these disorders.",2023.0
37209427,"A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, Phase 1b crossover trial comparing two doses of ulotaront with placebo in the treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy.",Szabo ST; Hopkins SC; Lew R; Loebel A; Roth T; Koblan KS,2023 Jul,Sleep medicine,"Ulotaront (SEP-363856) is a novel agonist at trace amine-associated receptor 1 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors in clinical development for the treatment of schizophrenia. Previous studies demonstrated ulotaront suppresses rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in both rodents and healthy volunteers. We assessed acute and sustained treatments of ulotaront on REM sleep and symptoms of cataplexy and alertness in subjects with narcolepsy-cataplexy.

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3-way crossover study, ulotaront was evaluated in 16 adults with narcolepsy-cataplexy. Two oral doses of ulotaront (25 mg and 50 mg) were administered daily for 2 weeks and compared with matching placebo (6-treatment sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment).

Acute treatment with both 25 mg and 50 mg of ulotaront reduced minutes spent in nighttime REM compared to placebo. A sustained 2-week administration of both doses of ulotaront reduced the mean number of short-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) during daytime multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) compared to placebo. Although cataplexy events decreased from the overall mean baseline during the 2-week treatment period, neither dose of ulotaront statistically separated from placebo (p = 0.76, 25 mg; p = 0.82, 50 mg), and no significant improvement in patient and clinician measures of sleepiness from baseline to end of the 2-week treatment period occurred in any treatment group.

Acute and sustained treatment with ulotaront reduced nighttime REM duration and daytime SOREMPs, respectively. The effect of ulotaront on suppression of REM did not demonstrate a statistical or clinically meaningful effect in narcolepsy-cataplexy.

Patients with narcolepsy were consecutively recruited. All patients were separated into early- and late-onset groups according to the onset age of disease ≤ 15 and > 15 years, respectively. Demographic, clinical, and sleep parameters were compared between the two groups. Linear regressions were performed to examine the risk factors of subjective and objective EDS in patients with early- and late-onset narcolepsy.

A total of 101 patients with narcolepsy (median age at recruitment = 18.0 years) were classified into an early-onset group (67 patients with median age at onset = 12.0 years) and a late-onset group (34 patients with median age at onset = 28.5 years). Compared with early-onset group, late-onset group scored significantly higher on Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS), sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) questionnaire-Hong Kong (all P < 0.050). UNS-cataplexy and sleep paralysis had significantly positive associations with subjective EDS, and N1%, arousal index, and periodic limb movements index were positively associated with objective EDS in the early-onset group (all P < 0.050). However, these associations were not observed in late-onset narcolepsy.

Late onset narcolepsy had more severe self-reported narcolepsy symptoms. REM sleep related symptoms and disrupted nighttime sleep were associated with EDS in early-onset narcolepsy. These findings suggest that early- and late-onset narcolepsy may represent two distinct phenotypes.",2023.0

Our study aimed to determine the changes in muscle tone (atonia index, AI) at different levels of vigilance during the entire multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and each nap in people with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and 2 (NT2) compared with other hypersomnias and its potential diagnostic value.

Twenty-nine patients with NT1 (11 M 18F, mean age 34.9 years, SD 16.8) and sixteen with NT2 (10 M 6F, mean age 39 years, SD 11.8) and 20 controls with other hypersomnias (10 M, 10F mean age 45.1 years, SD 15.1) were recruited. AI was evaluated at different levels of vigilance (Wake and REM sleep) in each nap and throughout the MSLT of each group. The validity of AI in identifying patients with narcolepsy (NT1 and NT2) was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

AI during wakefulness (WAI) was significantly higher in the narcolepsy groups (NT1 and NT2 p < 0.001) compared to the hypersomniac group. AI during REM sleep (RAI) (p = 0.03) and WAI in nap with sudden onsets of REM sleep periods (SOREMP) (p = 0.001) were lower in NT1 than in NT2. The ROC curves showed high AUC values for WAI (NT1 0.88; Best Cut-off > 0.57, Sensitivity 79.3 % Specificity 90 %; NT2 0.89 Best Cut-off > 0.67 Sensitivity 87.5 % Specificity 95 %; NT1 and NT2 0.88 Best Cut-off > 0.57 Sensitivity 82.2 % Specificity 90 %) in discriminating subjects suffering from other hypersomnias.

A retrospective study of all adult patients living with craniopharyngioma referred to the sleep clinic, who received a sleep interview, nocturnal polysomnography, multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT), and 18-h bed rest polysomnography. Their sleep measurements were compared with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls.

Of 54 patients screened with craniopharyngioma, 42 were analyzed, 80% of whom complained of excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep testing revealed that 6 (14.3%) of them had secondary narcolepsy (including one with cataplexy), and 11 (26.2%) had central hypersomnia associated with a medical disorder. Compared with controls, patients were more frequently obese, had a shorter mean sleep latency on MSLT, and slept longer on the first night. There was a nonsignificant trend for patients with (vs. without) narcolepsy and hypersomnia to be younger, to have a higher body mass index, to be more likely to have received radiation therapy, and to have more severe damage to the hypothalamus after surgery. Treatment with stimulants (modafinil, pitolisant, and methylphenidate) was beneficial in 9/10 patients.

We studied the temporal distribution of SOREMPs and associated sleep stages in the MSLT of patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and other hypersomnias (OH).

We reviewed consecutive five-nap MSLTs and their preceding PSG from 83 untreated adult patients with hypersomnolence and ≥1 SOREMPs. Wake/N1(W/N1)-SOREMPs, N2-SOREMPs, and N3 sleep presence and time of appearance were analyzed.

Thirty-nine patients had NT1 and 44 OH. There were 183 (78%) SOREMPs in patients with NT1 and 83 (31%) in OH. Sixty-seven percent of SOREMPs in NT1 were from W/N1, and 20% -none from wake-in OH (p < 0.001). Most patients (94%) with ≥2 W/N1-SOREMPs had NT1 (specificity 95%, sensitivity 82%).

36535226,Assessment of glymphatic function in narcolepsy using DTI-ALPS index.,Gumeler E; Aygun E; Tezer FI; Saritas EU; Oguz KK,2023 Jan,Sleep medicine,"Sleep is a modulator of glymphatic activity which is altered in various sleep disorders. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), rapid onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, cataplexy, disturbed night sleep with fragmentation. It is categorized into two types, type 1 (NT1) and type 2 (NT2) depending on the presence of cataplexy and/or absence of orexin. We sought for alterations in glymphatic activity in narcoleptic patients using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) along perivascular space (ALPS) index on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Adult patients diagnosed with NT1 or NT2 who had polysomnography (PSG) and MRI with DTI were included in the study. Sleep recording included Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, sleep latency during multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), sleep efficiency during night PSG, wake after sleep onset (WASO), REM sleep latency during PSG, percentage of non-REM (NREM), REM sleep and wakefulness during night PSG. DTI-ALPS index was calculated for each patient and age-sex matched healthy control(HC)s.

The study group was composed of 25 patients [F/M = 15/10, median age = 34 (29.5-44.5)], 14 with NT1 and 11 with NT2 disease. ESS, WASO and percentage of wakefulness were significantly higher in NT1 patients (p < 0.05). Mean DTI-ALPS was not significantly different neither between narcoleptic patients and HCs, nor between NT1 and NT2 patients (all, p > 0.05). However, DTI-ALPS was negatively correlated with WASO (r = -0.745, p = 0.013) and percentage of wakefulness (r = -0.837, p = 0.005) in NT1 patients. DTI-ALPS correlated negatively with percentage of N1 sleep (r = -0.781, p = 0.005) but positively with REM percentage (r = 0.618, p = 0.043) in NT2 patients.

In this study, DTI-ALPS was not significantly different in narcoleptic patients than the HCs. However, the glymphatic index as assessed by DTI-ALPS correlated with PSG parameters; negatively with WASO, percentage of wakefulness in NT1, percentage of N1 sleep in NT2, and positively with REM sleep in NT2. A tendency for a reduction in DTI-ALPS in NT1 patients compared to both NT2 patients and HCs was also found. These findings might show the first evidence of an alteration of glymphatic activity, especially in NT1 patients, thus warrant further prospective studies in larger size of narcoleptic patient cohorts.",2023.0

When associated with a sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) narcolepsy is classified as type 1, while the absence of cataplexy indicates type 2. Genetic, degenerative, and immunological hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of NT1 are still a matter of debate. To contribute to the understanding of NT1 genetic basis, here we describe, for the first time, a whole genome analysis of a monozygotic twin pair discordant for NT1.

We present the case of a pair of 17-year-old male, monozygotic twins discordant for NT1. The affected twin had Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) of 20 (can range from 0 to 24), cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, polysomnography without abnormalities, multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) positive for narcolepsy, a mean sleep latency of 3 min, sleep-onset REM periods SOREMPs of 5, presence of allele HLA-DQB1*06:02, and Hypocretin-1 level of zero pg/mL (normal values are > 200 pg/mL). The other twin had no narcolepsy symptoms (ESS of 4), normal polysomnography, MSLT without abnormalities, presence of allele HLA-DQB1*06:02, and Hypocretin-1 level of 396,74 pg/mL. To describe the genetic background for the NT1 discordant manifestations in this case, we present the whole-genome analysis of this monozygotic twin pair. The whole-genome comparison revealed that both twins have identical NT1 pathogenic mutations in known genes, such as HLA-DQB1*06:02:01, HLA-DRB1*11:01:02/*15:03:01. The affected twin has the expected clinical manifestation while the unaffected twin has an unexpected phenotype. The unaffected twin has significantly more frameshift mutations as compared to the affected twin (108 versus 75) and mutations that affect stop codons (61 versus 5 in stop gain, 26 versus 2 in start lost).

The differences observed in frameshift and stop codon mutations in the unaffected twin are consistent with loss-of-function effects and protective alleles, that are almost always associated with loss-of-function rare alleles. Also, overrepresentation analysis of genes containing variants with potential clinical relevance in the unaffected twin shows that most mutations are in genes related to immune regulation function, Golgi apparatus, MHC, and olfactory receptor. These observations support the hypothesis that NT1 has an immunological basis although protective mutations in non-HLA alleles might interfere with the expression of the NT1 phenotype and consequently, with the clinical manifestation of the disease.",2022.0

The largest series of patients (n = 110) was reported by A. Vein (doctoral thesis: Hypersomnia Syndrome) in 1964. However, until today, narcolepsy remained relatively unknown in Russia. The aim of this study is to report clinical and polysomnography (PSG)/multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results in the Russian population and compare them with the European Narcolepsy Network (EU-NN) data (n = 1099) reported.

Eleven sleep centers from Russia agreed to participate and completed a questionnaire including 58 questions concerning demographic, clinical, PSG, and MSLT data.

There were 89 patients with a mean age of 35.6 ± 16.9 years (± here and further indicates standard deviation), 58% males, and 42% females. Narcolepsy started at a mean age of 25.6 ± 14.6 years (range 5-74 years). The mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 18.4 ± 3.5 points (range: 11-24). Sleep paralysis was reported by 59.1%, and hallucinations by 82% of patients. In MSLT, ≥ 2 sleep-onset REM (rapid eye movement) periods (SOREMPs) were found in 81.6%. No center provided human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or cerebral spinal fluid hypocretin data.

Clinical and neurophysiological data from this first study of the Russian Narcolepsy Network suggest a similar profile to the recently reported EU-NN data. The more severe and higher percentage of patients with cataplexy and presenting with both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy may reflect low awareness of narcolepsy in Russia.

Item response theory (IRT) assumptions were tested and psychometric properties were analysed. Matching on sex ratio and age was conducted to estimate concurrent criterion, diagnostic validity and cut-offs.

IRT assumptions were validated confirming the one-dimensionality of the FSSA8. The latent continuum sleepiness for which the scale and its items are reliable encompassed most of the clinical subjects. FSSA8 is weakly correlated with MSLT. Distribution of scores for the nonclinical group and the clinical group differed significantly; the FSSA8 had very good screening validity in sleep disorders. The cut-off was seven points.

The FSSA8 appeared to be more reliable for patients than for nonclinical participants and to be a good tool for screening excessive daytime sleepiness in sleep disorders.",2023.0
36222741,Rapid eye movement sleep duration during the multiple sleep latency test to diagnose hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy.,Lopez R; Barateau L; Laura Rassu A; Evangelista E; Chenini S; Scholz S; Jaussent I; Dauvilliers Y,2023 Jan 11,Sleep,"To assess the performances of alternative measures of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) to identify hypocretin-deficiency in patients with a complaint of hypersomnolence, including patients with narcolepsy.

MSLT parameters from 374 drug-free patients with hypersomnolence, with complete clinical and polysomnographic (PSG) assessment and cerebrospinal hypocretin-1 measurement were collected. Conventional (sleep latency, number of sleep onset REM-SOREM-periods) and alternative (sleep duration, REM sleep latency and duration, sleep stage transitions) MSLT measures were compared as function of hypocretin-1 levels (≤110 vs > 110 pg/mL). We performed receiver-operating characteristics analyses to determine the best thresholds of MSLT parameters to identify hypocretin-deficiency in the global population and in subgroups of patients with narcolepsy (i.e. typical cataplexy and/or positive PSG/MSLT criteria, n = 223).

Patients with hypocretin-deficiency had shorter mean sleep and REM sleep latencies, longer mean sleep and REM sleep durations and more direct REM sleep transitions during the MSLT. The current standards of MSLT/PSG criteria identified hypocretin-deficient patients with a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.69, and 0.81/0.99 when combined with cataplexy. A mean REM sleep duration ≥ 4.1 min best identified hypocretin-deficiency in patients with hypersomnolence (AUC = 0.932, sensitivity 0.87, specificity 0.86) and ≥ 5.7 min in patients with narcolepsy (AUC = 0.832, sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.82).

Compared to the current neurophysiological standard criteria, alternative MSLT parameters would better identify hypocretin-deficiency among patients with hypersomnolence and those with narcolepsy. We highlighted daytime REM sleep duration as a relevant neurophysiological biomarker of hypocretin-deficiency to be used in clinical and research settings.",2023.0

We hypothesised that the rate of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1*0602 positivity in the Australian cohort would be comparable to international registries.

The current study aims to evaluate epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Australian patients with HOCO, including prevalence of HLA DQB1*0602 positivity, the most specific HLA marker associated with narcolepsy.

This is a retrospective study. Patients ≥ 16 years of age presenting with symptoms of hypersomnolence who attended one of two Australian sleep centres (New South Wales and Queensland) in the preceding 24 months and had undergone both HLA serology and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) were included. Main outcome measures included demographics, HLA DQB1*0602 positivity, MSLT, and clinical parameters (presence of auxiliary narcolepsy symptoms, laboratory tests, relevant prescribed medications).

Eighty-eight patients were included. HLA DQB1*0602 positivity was highest in those with type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) (95.7%) and lowest in those without a classifiable disorder (9.1%). Mean sleep latency was lowest and number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) highest in the NT1 group. Comorbid disorders, particularly depression and overweight/obesity, were prevalent in all cohorts. Across all diagnostic groups, dexamphetamine was the most commonly prescribed agent for excessive daytime sleepiness.

Patients with HOCO assessed in two specialised Australian clinics demonstrate comparable clinical characteristics to other published cohorts internationally; however, available pharmacological agents in Australia do not reflect international standards of care.",2023.0

Mixing/dissociation of sleep stages in narcolepsy adds to the difficulty in automatic sleep staging. Moreover, automatic analytical studies for narcolepsy and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) have only done automatic sleep staging without leveraging the sleep stage profile for further patient identification. This study aims to establish an automatic narcolepsy detection method for MSLT.Approach.We construct a two-phase model on MSLT recordings, where ambiguous sleep staging and sleep transition dynamics make joint efforts to address this issue. In phase 1, we extract representative features from electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) signals. Then, the features are input to an EasyEnsemble classifier for automatic sleep staging. In phase 2, we investigate sleep transition dynamics, including sleep stage transitions and sleep stages, and output likelihood of narcolepsy by virtue of principal component analysis (PCA) and a logistic regression classifier. To demonstrate the proposed framework in clinical application, we conduct experiments on 24 participants from the Children's Hospital of Fudan University, considering ten patients with narcolepsy and fourteen patients with MSLT negative.Main results.Applying the two-phase leave-one-subject-out testing scheme, the model reaches an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 87.5%, 80.0%, and 92.9% for narcolepsy detection. Influenced by disease pathology, accuracy of automatic sleep staging in narcolepsy appears to decrease compared to that in the non-narcoleptic population.Significance.This method can automatically and efficiently distinguish patients with narcolepsy based on MSLT. It probes into the amalgamation of automatic sleep staging and sleep transition dynamics for narcolepsy detection, which would assist clinic and neuroelectrophysiology specialists in visual interpretation and diagnosis.",2022.0

A total of 267 pediatric NT1 patients (194 males and 73 females, 5-17 years old) were evaluated for ADHD symptoms by a psychiatrist using the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI Kid) from February 2011 to July 2013 at Peking University People's Hospital. All patients underwent Stanford Sleep Inventory (SSI) evaluation and polysomnography followed by multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) before ER-MPH treatment. Neuropsychological evaluations, including the Inventory of Subjective Life Quality (ISLQ), Depression Self-resting Scale for Children (DSRS-C), Screening for Child Anxiety-related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), were performed before and after 16 weeks of ER-MPH treatment. Executive abilities were assessed by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-parent version (BRIEF-P). The narcolepsy symptoms, evaluated by the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), and ADHD symptoms were assessed before and after treatment in NT1 patients with ADHD.

Seventy-seven of 267 (28.8%) NT1 patients had ADHD symptoms, with 73 patients being inattentive type (ADHD-I) and 4 patients being combined type (ADHD-C). Despite similar objective sleep parameters, NT1 patients with ADHD symptoms experienced higher anxiety levels, more impulsive behaviors, lower health-related quality of life and worse executive functions than those without ADHD (p<0.05). Methylphenidate treatment was effective in improving daytime sleepiness in NT1 patients with ADHD (PSQ, 16.7 ± 2.1 vs 13.5 ± 1.9, p<0.05) but was ineffective on ADHD symptoms (ADHD-RS, 25.3 ± 9.1 vs 26.4 ± 8.9, p>0.05).

A high prevalence of ADHD (28.8%) was identified in children and adolescents with NT1. Comorbid ADHD symptoms were associated with increased levels of mood disorders and lower quality of life. ER-MPH treatment could reduce daytime sleepiness but not ADHD symptoms in narcolepsy patients with ADHD, suggesting that new treatment strategies are needed for this group of patients.",2022.0

We determined the clinical and diagnostic characteristics of patients with intermediate hypocretin-1 levels (111-200 pg/mL) and the diagnostic value of cataplexy characteristics in individuals with central disorders of hypersomnolence.

Retrospective cross-sectional study of 355 people with known CSF hypocretin-1 levels who visited specialized Sleep-Wake Centers in the Netherlands. For n = 271, we had full data on cataplexy type (""typical"" or ""atypical"" cataplexy).

Compared to those with normal hypocretin-1 levels (>200 pg/mL), a higher percentage of individuals with intermediate hypocretin-1 levels had typical cataplexy (75% or 12/16 vs 9% or 8/88, p < .05), and/or met the diagnostic polysomnographic (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) criteria for narcolepsy (50 vs 6%, p < .001). Of those with typical cataplexy, 88% had low, 7% intermediate, and 5% normal hypocretin-1 levels (p < .001). Atypical cataplexy was also associated with hypocretin deficiency but to a lesser extent. A hypocretin-1 cutoff of 150 pg/mL best predicted the presence of typical cataplexy and/or positive PSG and MSLT findings.

Individuals with intermediate hypocretin-1 levels or typical cataplexy more often have outcomes fitting the PSG and MSLT criteria for narcolepsy than those with normal levels or atypical cataplexy. In addition, typical cataplexy has a much stronger association with hypocretin-1 deficiency than atypical cataplexy. We suggest increasing the NT1 diagnostic hypocretin-1 cutoff and adding the presence of clearly defined typical cataplexy to the diagnostic criteria of NT1.

Except for the hypocretin deficiency and cataplexy, all clinical and laboratory features used in the diagnosis of NT2 are identical to those used for NT1. The aim of this study was to assess the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-related characteristics in the patients with narcolepsy; the characteristics of REM sleep in polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) recordings, the quantification of REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) and atonia index, and the analysis of rapid eye movements (REMs) during REM sleep.

This study was planned by the Sleep Medicine Study Group of the Turkish Neurology Society, and conducted in 11 centers in eight cities in Turkey. The analysis of RSWA was analyzed by reviewing all REM sleep periods on nocturnal PSG and MSLT recordings per standard criteria. The total duration of the increased muscle tone during REM sleep in the chin and bilateral leg electromyography (EMG) recordings was calculated as RSWA index. The REMs index was also investigated the relation to the RSWA.

A total of 274 patients were involved; 147 patients (53.6%) were males and 127 patients (46.4%) were females; the mean age was 29.1 ± 12.0 years. The diagnosis of NT1 was made in 166 patients (60.6%), and 108 patients (39.4%) were diagnosed as having NT2. The mean Epworth sleepiness scale score was significantly higher in patients with NT1 than the patients with NT2 (P = 0.001). The diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was made in 19.3% of the patients with NT1 versus in 2.8% of the patients with NT2 (P < 0.001). The percentage of SOREMP in PSG recordings was significantly higher in patients with NT1 (37.1%) than those with NT2 (18.9%, P = 0.001). MSLT showed that the mean sleep latency was shorter in patients with NT1 compared to those with NT2 (P < 0.001). The total duration of REMs on electrooculography recordings was also significantly higher in patients with RSWA in comparison with the patients without RSWA (P = 0.002). Total duration of REMs was significantly and positively correlated with the duration of RSWA on chin-EMG and leg-EMG recordings (P = 0.001). ROC analyses showed an RSWA index of ≥2% for the RSWA on chin-EMG with a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 71.3% (P < 0.001). The REMs index ≥20% was associated with the presence of RSWA with a sensitivity of 70.0% and a specificity of 57.1% (P = 0.008).

In this nation-wide study, we identified for the first time that the increase in REMs density during REM sleep may be a major correlate of the RSWA. Significant positive correlations were demonstrated between the total duration of REMs on electrooculography recordings and the mean durations of RSWA in both chin and leg EMG recordings. A REMs index of >20% was demonstrated to have a moderate sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of RSWA. As observed in chin RSWA index, REMs index also showed a significantly high association with RBD, in comparison to RSWA per standard criteria.",2022.0
35180477,REM sleep latency changes after version 2.1 of the AASM manual for scoring sleep.,Mayà G; Gaig C; Iranzo À; Santamaria J,2022 Feb,Sleep medicine,"The classical criteria for scoring REM sleep changed in version 2.1 of the AASM manual for scoring sleep, by allowing N1 epochs with atonia precedent and contiguous to definite REM sleep to be scored as REM sleep in the absence of rapid eye movements when the EEG was compatible. This may shorten the REM latency in the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) in naps with wake/N1 to REM transitions, characteristic of narcolepsy type 1. Since REM latency of <5 or <6 min is a biomarker of NT-1 we have assessed the impact of this change in scoring REM sleep in the MSLT.

Ninety-two consecutive five-nap MSLT studies (460 naps) performed in our center between 2013 and 2019 for evaluation of hypersomnolence with ≥1 sleep onset REM (SOREM) naps were included. REM latencies were measured using both classical and new criteria.

SOREMs occurred in 255 (55.9%) naps, 134 directly from wake/N1. By using the new criteria REM latency shortened in 29.1% of these naps (mean 0.2 ± 0.5, range 0-3 min, p < 0.01), predominantly in females. Twenty-eight percent of MSLTs had at least one nap with a shortened REM latency (mean 0.1 min ± 0.2, p < 0.01). Only two MSLTs changed their REM latency to <5 min and none to <6 min with the new rules.

The criterion to define REM sleep onset significantly influences its latency and should be considered when comparing studies performed before or after version 2.1 modification. The clinical relevance of this scoring change is probably minimal.",2022.0

This study aimed to explore the differential longitudinal patterns of polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) in NT1 and NT2.

In this retrospective study demographic characteristics, PSG, and MSLT parameters at baseline and follow-up were compared between NT1 and NT2 patients. Patients with both follow-up MSLT and PSG were selected for sub-group analysis. Baseline and follow-up MSLT and PSG parameters were compared.

Of 55 patients with narcolepsy, mean follow-up periods were 7.4 ± 3.5 years for NT1 and 5.5 ± 2.9 for NT2. Demographic data showed increased body mass index and prevalence of sleep paralysis in NT1. Baseline PSG characteristics between NT1 and NT2 showed decreased sleep latency (p = 0.016) and REM latency (p = 0.046) in NT1 group when compared with NT2. Nocturnal SOREMP on PSG was more prevalent in NT1 (p = 0.017), and half of NT2 patients with nocturnal SOREMP on PSG changed their diagnoses to NT1. On follow-up PSG, NT1 displayed reductions in sleep stage N2 (p = 0.006) and N3 (p = 0.048), while wake after sleep onset (WASO) (p = 0.023) and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (p = 0.007) were significantly increased.

34021733,"Narcolepsy in Children: Sleep disorders in children, A rapidly evolving field seeking consensus.",Dye TJ; Simakajornboon N,2022 Aug,Pediatric pulmonology,"Narcolepsy is a life-long sleep disorder with two distinct subtypes, narcolepsy type I and narcolepsy type II. It is now well recognized that the loss of hypocretin neurons underlies the pathogenesis of narcolepsy type I, however, the pathogenesis of narcolepsy type II is currently unknown. Both genetic and environmental factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. There is increasing evidence that autoimmune processes may play a critical role in the loss of hypocretin neurons. Infections especially streptococcus and influenza have been proposed as a potential trigger for the autoimmune-mediated mechanism. Several recent studies have shown increased cases of pediatric narcolepsy following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The increased cases in Europe seem to be related to a specific type of H1N1 influenza vaccination (Pandemrix), while the increased cases in China are related to influenza infection. Children with narcolepsy can have an unusual presentation at disease onset including complex motor movements which may lead to delayed diagnosis. All classic narcolepsy tetrads are present in only a small proportion of children. The diagnosis of narcolepsy is confirmed by either obtaining cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin or overnight sleep study with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). There are limitations of using MSLT in young children such that a negative MSLT test cannot exclude narcolepsy. HLA markers have limited utility in narcolepsy, but it may be useful in young children with clinical suspicion of narcolepsy. For management, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments are important in the management of narcolepsy. Pharmacotherapy is primarily aimed to address excessive daytime sleepiness and REM-related symptoms such as cataplexy. In addition to pharmacotherapy, routine screening of behavioral and psychosocial issues is warranted to identify patients who would benefit from bio-behavior intervention.",2022.0

In order to better understand worldwide trends in clinical assessment and management of narcolepsy, a survey of health-care providers was conducted by the World Sleep Society Narcolepsy task force.

A total of 146 surveys that included items on the diagnosis and management of narcolepsy were completed by practitioners representing 37 countries.

Most of the participants were from Europe, North America, Oceania, Asia and Latin America. A consistent approach to applying the diagnostic criteria of Narcolepsy was documented with the exception of measurement of CSF hypocretin-1, which has limited availability. While the majority of practitioners (58%) reported not using the test, 1% indicated always evaluating CSF hypocretin-1 levels. There was much variability in the availability of currently recommended medications such as sodium oxybate and pitolisant; modafinil and antidepressants were the most commonly used medications. Amphetamines were unavailable in some countries.

The results of the study highlight clinical and therapeutic realities confronted by worldwide physicians in the management of narcolepsy. While the diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy rely in part on the quantification of CSF hypocretin-1, few physicians reported having incorporated this test into their routine assessment of the condition. Regional differences in the management of narcolepsy appeared to be related to geographic availability and expense of the therapeutic agents.",2021.0

Mutiple sleep latentcy test (MSLT) showed that the average sleep latency was 3.1 min, and abnormal REM sleep episodes were detected in 4 naps. The average REM latency was 1.3 min. We review the knowledge and researches on this disease in Mainland China in the past 10 years. Data from China in 2014 showed a significant increase in the incidence of narcolepsy in 2011 after the H1N1 epidemic in China in 2009. Despite the low incidence rate, diagnosis of narcolepsy is still confusing and needs clinicians' attention. Whether the incidence of narcolepsy may increase after covid19 remains to be observed. So far, there is no clear evidence to support immunotherapy. In conclusion, further studies are needed to verify more treatments and improve the patient's life quality.",2021.0

However, there are still unexplained phenotypic NT1 features. We investigated the associations between clinical and sleep phenotypic characteristics, the NT1-associated P2RY11 polymorphism rs2305795, and P2Y11 protein levels in T lymphocytes in patients with NT1, their first-degree relatives and unrelated controls.

The P2RY11 SNP was genotyped in 100 patients (90/100 H1N1-(Pandemrix)-vaccinated), 119 related and 123 non-related controls. CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte P2Y11 protein levels were quantified using flow cytometry in 167 patients and relatives. Symptoms and sleep recording parameters were also collected.

We found an association between NT1 and the rs2305795 A allele (OR = 2, 95% CI (1.3, 3.0), p = 0.001). T lymphocyte P2Y11 protein levels were significantly lower in patients and relatives homozygous for the rs2305795 risk A allele (CD4: p = 0.012; CD8: p = 0.007). The nocturnal sleep fragmentation index was significantly negatively correlated with patients' P2Y11 protein levels (CD4: p = 0.004; CD8: p = 0.006). Mean MSLT sleep latency, REM-sleep latency, and core clinical symptoms were not associated with P2Y11 protein levels.

We confirmed that the P2RY11 polymorphism rs2305795 is associated with NT1 also in a mainly H1N1-(Pandemrix)-vaccinated cohort. We demonstrated that homozygosity for the A risk allele is associated with lower P2Y11 protein levels. A high level of nocturnal sleep fragmentation was associated with low P2Y11 levels in patients. This suggests that P2Y11 has a previously unknown function in sleep-wake stabilization that affects the severity of NT1.",2021.0

Severe sleepiness usually causes a greater handicap than manifestations of narcolepsy.

Forty-three IH patients (17 male, mean age 42.8 ± SD 12.2 years, range 20-67), diagnosed in the past 20 years according to ICSD-2 or ICSD-3 criteria were invited for clinical examination to evaluate the course, manifestations and severity of the disease, as well as clinical comorbidities. The patients completed a set of questionnaires scoring sleepiness, sleep inertia, fatigue, depression, anxiety, circadian preference, and quality of life.

IH patients were divided according to the duration of nocturnal sleep at the time of their diagnosis into two cohorts: (1) with normal sleep duration (n = 25, 58.1%) and (2) with long sleep duration (n = 18, 41.9%). The mean duration of ad libitum sleep per 22 h in the second cohort was 732.0 ± 115.4 min (range 603-1100), and women markedly prevailed (n = 14, 77.8%). Age at disease onset was younger in the group with long sleep duration (21.2 ± 11.4 years versus 28.1 ± 13.6 years, p = 0.028), their MSLT latency was longer (7.2 ± 3.7 min versus 5.1 ± 1.7 min, p = 0.005), a history of sleep inertia prevailed (p = 0.005), and daily naps were mostly non-refreshing (p = 0.014). Additionally, questionnaires in the group with long sleep duration showed more severe sleep inertia (p = 0.007), fatigue (p = 0.004), and a tendency towards evening chronotype (p = 0.001).

IH patients with long sleep duration differ clinically as well as by objective measures at the time of diagnosis and in long-term follow up from IH patients without long 24-h sleep time.

This study aims to describe MSLT and polysomnography (PSG) findings, including frequency and distribution of SOREMP during the day, in a large cohort of patients with central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH). We retrospectively analyzed electrophysiological data from MSLT and PSG in 370 consecutive patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, n = 97), type 2 (NT2, n = 31), idiopathic hypersomnia (IH, n = 48), nonorganic hypersomnia (NOH, n = 116) and insufficient sleep syndrome (ISS, n = 78). NT1 and NT2 patients had a significantly shorter mean Sleep Latency (mSL) and REM-Latency (REML) in MSLT and PSG. SOREMP occurred more frequently in narcoleptic vs. non-narcoleptic patients in MSLT and PSG. Occurrence of 3 or more SOREMP in MSLT and a SOREMP in PSG had a very high specificity and positive predictive value (98%/96% and 100% respectively), however relatively low sensitivity (65% and 45% respectively). NT1 more than NT2 patients have shorter mSL and more frequent SOREMP in MSLT and shorter SL as well as REML during nocturnal PSG. Increasing numbers of SOREMP in MSLT and especially SOREMP during PSG increase specificity on the expense of sensitivity in diagnosing narcolepsy. Therefore, frequency of SOREMP in MSLT naps and PSG can help to discriminate but not clearly separate narcoleptic from non-narcoleptic patients.",2021.0

Serum LPGDS, CSF LPGDS, and CSF hypocretin-1(Hcrt-1) levels were measured by ELISA in 122 narcolepsy patients (106 NT1 and 16 NT2), 27 IH, and 51Con.

LPGDS levels in CSF (p = 0.02) and serum (p < 0.001) were 22%-25% lower in control subjects than in patients with EDS complaints, including NT1, NT2, and IH. In contrast to significant differences in CSF Hcrt-1 levels, CSF L-PGDS levels and serum L-PGDS were comparable among NT1, NT2, and IH (p > 0.05), except for slightly lower serum LPGDS in IH than in NT1 (p = 0.01). Serum L-PGDS correlated modestly and negatively to sleep latency on MSLT (r = -0.227, p = 0.007) in hypersomnia subjects.

As a somnogen-producing enzyme, CSF/serum LPGDS may serve as a new biomarker for EDS of central origin and imply a common pathogenetic association, but would complement rather than replaces orexin markers.",2021.0

This study is the first to assess the impact of a 5-nap protocol on meeting MSLT-derived diagnostic criteria in a general cohort referred for MSLT, without selection bias.

Data for all MSLTs performed at 2 tertiary sleep units in Australia between May 2012 and May 2018 were retrospectively assessed for the impact of the fifth nap on mean sleep latency (MSL) and sleep onset rapid eye movement periods.

There were 122 MSLTs included. The MSL was 8.7 ± 5.1 minutes after 4 naps, compared with 9.2 ± 5.2 minutes for 5 naps (P < .0001). In 8 cases, inclusion of the fifth nap changed the MSL to a value above the diagnostic threshold of 8 minutes. There were no instances in which the MSL moved to ≤ 8 minutes based on fifth nap data. A sleep onset rapid eye movement period occurred in the fifth nap in 9 patients and altered the interpretation in 2 cases.

The fifth nap in an MSLT is associated with an increased MSL, although this difference is rarely clinically significant. In patients with borderline MSL or 1 sleep onset rapid eye movement period after 4 naps, a fifth nap can alter the outcome and should be performed. However, for many cases, a 4-nap MSLT protocol will suffice, potentially allowing resource savings without compromising diagnostic accuracy. We propose the adoption of a conditional 4-nap or 5-nap protocol based on specific criteria.",2021.0
33045884,The impact of the HLA DQB1 gene and amino acids on the development of narcolepsy.,Kachooei-Mohaghegh-Yaghoobi L; Rezaei-Rad F; Sadeghniiat-Haghighi K; Zamani M,2022 Jul,The International journal of neuroscience,"Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological and a genetic disorder of autoimmune origin, which is characterized by five main symptoms, including excessive day time sleepiness, sudden loss of muscle tone or cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, and disturbed nocturnal sleep. While there are several diagnostic tests for Narcolepsy such as MSLT (mean sleep latency test), polysomnography and low range of hypocretin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sensitivity and specificity in these methodologies are not sufficient enough. Therefore, methods with higher sensitivity for the accurate diagnosis and confirmation of the disease are necessary.

According to the infrequent prevalence of narcolepsy disease, we scheduled a case-control association study with 20 narcoleptic patients and 150 healthy individuals in a high-resolution HLA typing procedure employing SSP-PCR.

Our study demonstrates that the DQB1*06:02 allele provides the highest susceptibility with absolute risk of 0.13%, for Narcolepsy (P = 1x10-14, RR = 60.5, PcPPV = 0.13%), while, HLA-DQB1* 03:05 allele presents protection to Narcolepsy (P = 1x10-4, PcPPV = 3.19x10-4%). Furthermore, for the first time, the AA analysis displayed that AA serine182 and threonine185 located on epitope of DQβ1 chain receptor (DQB1Ser182,Thr185) present significant susceptibility for Narcolepsy (Pc= 87.03 × 10-13, PcPPV = 0.024%) while, asparagine182 located on epitope of DQβ1 protein receptor (DQB1Asn182) confers the highest protection against development of Narcolepsy (Pc= 2.16 × 10-5, PcPPV = 0.0012%).

Thus, this can be proposed that the polymorphic differences in the epitope of the HLA receptor could contribute to their differential association with the Narcolepsy in Iranian population.",2022.0

With this retrospective and purely descriptive study, we aimed to compare the frequency of narcolepsy type 2 compared to the well-described narcolepsy type 1, in a large (n = 3,782) retrospective sample from a single tertiary sleep centre. After 2 weeks washout of sleep-wake active medication, all patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (n = 1,392) underwent 2 weeks actigraphy, polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test, and all diagnoses were made along current diagnostic criteria. Narcolepsy type 1 was diagnosed in 91 patients, and 191 patients without cataplexy had multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results indicating narcolepsy. After exclusion of shift work syndrome (n = 19), suspected insufficient sleep syndrome (n = 128), delayed sleep phase syndrome (n = 4) and obstructive sleep apnea (n = 34), six patients were diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2, of whom two patients later developed narcolepsy type 1. Altogether, our observations suggest that narcolepsy type 2 exists, but its frequency may be much lower compared to narcolepsy type 1. In addition, they emphasize the importance of scrupulously excluding other potential causes of sleepiness, if possible, with 2-week actigraphy and polysomnography.",2021.0

A total of 50 consecutively enrolled post-H1N1 NT1 youths (7-20 years, 62% females, 98% HLA-DQB1∗06:02-positive, 98% CSF hypocretin-1 deficient, 88% vaccinated) were assessed after two weeks off medication for ADHD (ADHD diagnosis pre/post-narcolepsy, parent-rated ADHD symptoms) and narcolepsy-phenotyped (semi-structured interview, Stanford Sleep Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, polysomnography (PSG), Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)).

In sum, 26 (52%) and 15 (30%) of participants had ADHD symptoms above and below the clinical significant cut-off, respectively, while 9 (18%) had no ADHD symptoms. High values were found for ADHD total score (mean (SD), 17.9 (9.5)) and ADHD subscores (inattentive score, 11.0 (6.3); hyperactive/impulsivity score, 6.9 (4.7)). These were significantly higher than previously reported in a mainly medicated narcolepsy cohort (p < 0.0001). Age, gender and disease duration did not influence scores. Two participants (4%) had ADHD diagnosis prior to narcolepsy onset. ADHD symptoms were correlated with parent-rated, but not with patient rated ESS scores, objective sleepiness (mean sleep latency), sleep fragmentation (sleep stage shift index, awakening index), or CSF hypocretin-1 level.

Comorbid ADHD symptoms were more prevalent in unmedicated post-H1N1 NT1 youths than previously reported in mainly medicated pediatric narcolepsy cohorts. The high prevalence was not due to pre-existing ADHD and generally not correlated with core narcolepsy sleep/wake phenotype characteristics, indicating that the ADHD symptoms were not a direct consequence of disturbed sleep or daytime sleepiness.",2020.0

While practice parameters recommend discontinuation of antidepressants prior to multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT), data examining the impact of tapering these medications on MSLT results are limited.

Adult patients who underwent MSLT at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota, between 2014 and 2018 were included. Clinical and demographic characteristics, medications, including use of rapid eye movement-suppressing antidepressants (REMS-ADs) at assessment and during testing, actigraphy, and polysomnography data were manually abstracted. The difference in number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMs), proportion with ≥2 SOREMs, and mean sleep latency in patients who were using REMS-ADs and discontinued prior to testing versus those who remained on REMS-ADs were examined. At our center, all antidepressants are discontinued 2 weeks prior to MSLT, wherever feasible; fluoxetine is stopped 6 weeks prior. Regression analyses accounting for demographic, clinical, and other medication-related confounders were performed.

A total of 502 patients (age = 38.18 ± 15.90 years; 67% female) underwent MSLT; 178 (35%) were taking REMS-ADs at the time of assessment. REMS-AD was discontinued prior to MSLT in 121/178 (70%) patients. Patients whose REMS-AD was discontinued prior to MSLT were more likely to have ≥2 SOREMs (odds ratio: 12.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.60-92.94) compared with patients on REMS-ADs at MSLT. They also had shorter mean sleep latency (8.77 ± 0.46 vs 10.21 ± 0.28 minutes; P > .009) and higher odds of having ≥2 SOREMs (odds ratio: 2.22; 95% confidence interval: 1.23-3.98) compared with patients not taking REMS-ADs at initial assessment. These differences persisted after regression analyses accounting for confounders.

Patients who taper off REMS-ADs prior to MSLT are more likely to demonstrate ≥2 SOREMs and have a shorter mean sleep latency. Pending further prospective investigations, clinicians should preferably withdraw REMS-ADs before MSLT. If this is not done, the test interpretation should include a statement regarding the potential effect of the drugs on the results.",2020.0

Diagnostic criteria for NT1 include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) for at least three months not explained by any other condition, cataplexy and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 concentrations lower than 110 pg/ml. In this study we evaluated the utility of measuring CSF hypocretin-1 levels in patients with suspected narcolepsy (N).

The study included 29 consecutively recruited patients at a tertiary sleep centre presenting with EDS for exclusion of N. All patients were examined using an extensive clinical interview followed by two weeks of actigraphy and sleep diary recordings, polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT). Additionally, HLA-typing, urinary screening for substances of abuse and a lumbar puncture to measure CSF hypocretin-1 expression using radioimmunoassay were carried out.

In sum, 19 patients (66%) had a CSF hypocretin-1 level <110 pg/ml, of whom two had current severe depression without any features of narcolepsy except EDS. The predictive potential of hypocretin-1 measurement in diagnosing narcolepsy revealed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, a specificity of 83%, with both negative predictive value (NPV) and sensitivity equal to 100%.

Despite a high sensitivity and specificity, the MSLT is not always a reliable diagnostic test for narcolepsy and where this uncertainty exits, CSF hypocretin-1 concentrations <110 pg/ml can be useful. However, due to a lower PPV and specificity at this cut-off, it may also not be entirely reliable as a stand-alone diagnostic test, particularly in the context of severe depression.",2020.0

Inappropriate regulation of fatty acid metabolism has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of NT1, but the detailed mechanisms remain uncertain. Here we performed a metabolomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid samples from 14 NT1 and 17 control subjects using a novel capillary electrophoresis coupled with Fourier transform mass spectrometry. A total of 268 metabolites were identified and the amount of histidine was the most significantly increased in NT1 patients (p = 4.0 × 10-4). Validation analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) including independent replication samples also identified the association of histidine (p = 2.02 × 10-3). Further, levels of histamine, which is synthesized from histidine, were also examined using HPLC and were found to be significantly decreased in NT1 patients (p = 6.12 × 10-4). Pathway analysis with nominally significant metabolites identified several pathways related to the metabolism of glycogenic amino acids, suggesting that glycogenesis is enhanced in NT1 as a compensatory mechanism for fatty acid metabolism. We performed further exploratory analysis, searching for metabolites associated with sleep variables from polysomnography and the multiple sleep latency test. As a result, 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine showed a significant association with apnea-hypopnea index (p = 2.66 ×10-6). Moreover, gamma aminobutyric acid displayed a negative correlation with rapid eye movement sleep latency (REML), and thus might represent an intriguing target for future studies to elucidate how the controlling circuit of REM sleep is associated with abnormally short REML in NT1.",2020.0

Third, to test the accuracy of the ODSI to detect narcolepsy or IH (narcolepsy/IH) compared with the ESS.

A total of 181 patients complaining of excessive daytime sleepiness filled in the ESS and the ODSI and underwent measurements including actigraphy, full-night polysomnography, Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and 24-hour bedrest sleep recording.

Narcolepsy or IH was diagnosed in 76 patients. The ODSI found excessive daytime sleepiness in 92.3% of all patients and in 98.7% of those diagnosed with narcolepsy/IH. In the whole population, the ODSI was significantly positively correlated with the ESS (R = .547; 95% confidence interval: .436, .642; P < .001) and weakly with 24-hour total sleep time on bedrest recording (R = .208; 95% confidence interval: .056, .350; P = .047) but not with the Multiple Sleep Latency Test.

In this study, we report sleep-wake disturbances in children and adolescents with craniopharyngioma and associated clinical and treatment variables.

After surgery and prior to radiotherapy or observation, pediatric patients (n = 110) with craniopharyngioma ≥ 3 years old completed a baseline sleep clinic evaluation by a pediatric sleep specialist, polysomnography (PSG) and next-day multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). MSLT was limited to those ≥ 6 years old. Logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between patient characteristics and the presence and type of hypersomnia.

Amongst patients completing PSG and MSLT, 80% had polygraphic evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. Hypersomnia due to medical condition was diagnosed in 45% and narcolepsy in 35%. Overweight or obese patients were more likely to be diagnosed with hypersomnia (P = 0.012) or narcolepsy (P = 0.009). Grade 2 hypothalamic involvement (HI) at diagnosis was associated with the diagnosis of narcolepsy (P = 0.0008).

Most prior studies used nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) for the identification of sleep state misperception during nighttime. Our objective was to assess sleep state misperception during daytime in people with sleep disorders with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).

In this prospective observational study, we assessed the occurrence of, and factors influencing sleep state misperception in consecutive patients undergoing a routine multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) in a tertiary sleep-wake centre included between 2014 and 2017. Mixed models were applied to assess the influence of patients' clinical data on sleep state perception.

People with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, n = 33) and type 2 (NT2, n = 14), idiopathic hypersomnia (IH, n = 56), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, n = 31) and insufficient sleep syndrome (ISS, n = 31) were included. The prevalence of both classical and reverse sleep state misperception did not differ between the sleep disorders (mean 25%, range 8-37%) after correction for sleep stage, sleep onset latency and age. Longer sleep onset latency and reaching only non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage 1 were significant predictors for classical sleep state misperception.

Thirty drug-free cognitively intact adult NT1 patients were asked to report DE developed during each MSLT nap. Ten NT1 patients also spent voluntarily a supplementary night being awakened during the first-cycle and third-cycle REM sleep. Patients provided dream reports, white dreams, and no dreams, whose frequencies were matched in naps with SOREMP versus non-REM (NREM) sleep. All dream reports were then analyzed using story-grammar rules.

DE was recalled in detail (dream report) by NT1 patients after 75% of naps with SOREMP sleep and after 25% of naps with NREM sleep. Dream reports were provided by 8 out of 10 NT1 patients after both awakenings from nighttime REM sleep. Story-grammar analysis of dream reports showed that SOREMP-DEs are organized as hierarchically ordered sequences of events (so-called dream-stories), which are longer and more complex in the first and fourth SOREMP naps and are comparable with nighttime REM-DEs.

The similar structural organization of SOREMP-DEs with nighttime REM-DEs indicates that their underlying cognitive processes are highly, albeit not uniformly, effective during daytime SOREMP sleep. Given the peculiar neurophysiology of SOREMP sleep, investigating SOREMP-DEs may cast further light on the relationships between the neurophysiological and psychological processes involved in REM-dreaming.",2020.0

Recently, the characteristic sleep stage sequences preceding SOREMPs in narcolepsy have received attention, but their diagnostic utility remains unclear.

We retrospectively reviewed PSG/MSLT records and chart data for 102 Japanese patients with hypersomnia and at least one SOREMP. We examined the sporadic rates of two sleep stage sequences preceding the SOREMPs-wakefulness or stage 1 to REM (W/S1→R) and stage 2 to REM (S2→R)-comparing these between patient groups with narcolepsy type 1 (N = 28), narcolepsy type 2 (N = 19), and other hypersomnia (N = 55). We also examined the utility of three simple indices using the occurrence of W/S1→R SOREMPs for distinguishing between narcolepsy and other hypersomnia in patients who satisfied the minimum narcolepsy criteria.

W/S1→R SOREMPs were significantly more frequent in narcolepsy than in other hypersomnia, and this tendency was also observed even in the patients who satisfied the minimum narcolepsy criteria. The three indices had moderate sensitivities and specificities for distinguishing between narcolepsy and other hypersomnia in patients satisfying the minimum narcolepsy criteria.

The W/S1→R pattern was observed significantly more frequently in narcolepsy than in other hypersomnia, suggesting it may help with differentiating narcolepsy from other hypersomnia in patients demonstrating the narcolepsy criteria, although its ability to do so may be modest.",2020.0

According to the rules for pediatric population, an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (Obstructive AHI) ≥ 1 (comprising obstructive and mixed events), defined comorbid OSA.

NT1 children showed higher prevalence of overweight/obesity and severe nocturnal sleep disruption (lower sleep efficiency, and increased N1 sleep stage percentage) coupled with higher motor activity (periodic limb movement index [PLMi] and REM atonia index) compared to clinical controls. Sleep-related respiratory variables did not differ between NT1 and clinical controls (OSA prevalence of 13.2% and 4.8%, respectively). NT1 children with OSA were younger and showed lower N2 sleep stage percentage and higher PLMi than NT1 children without comorbid OSA. Overweight/obesity was not associated with OSA in NT1.

Despite higher body mass index (BMI), OSA prevalence did not differ between children with NT1 and clinical controls. OSA in pediatric NT1 patients is a rare and mild comorbidity, further contributing to nocturnal sleep disruption without effects on daytime sleepiness.",2020.0

Clinical, neurophysiologic, and, when available, biological data (HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity, CSF hcrt-1 levels) of 357 consecutive children below 18 years of age evaluated for suspected narcolepsy were collected. Best MSLT cutoffs were obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis by contrasting among patients with available CSF hcrt-1 assay (n = 228) with vs without CSF hcrt-1 deficiency, and further validated in patients without available CSF hcrt-1 against cataplexy (n = 129).

Patients with CSF hcrt-1 deficiency were best recognized using a mean MSLT sleep latency ≤8.2 minutes (area under the ROC curve of 0.985), or by at least 2 SOREMPs at the MSLT (area under the ROC curve of 0.975), or the combined PSG + MSLT (area under the ROC curve of 0.977). Although specificity and sensitivity of reference MSLT sleep latency ≤8 minutes and ≥2 SOREMPs (nocturnal SOREMP included) was 100% and 94.87%, the combination of MSLT sleep latency and SOREMP counts did not improve diagnostic accuracy. Age or sex also did not significantly influence these results in our pediatric population.

At least 2 SOREMPs or a mean sleep latency ≤8.2 minutes at the MSLT are valid and reliable markers for pediatric NT1 diagnosis, a result contrasting with adult NT1 criteria.

The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is an objective test that measures the tendency to fall asleep under controlled conditions. It is based on the notion that sleep latency reflects underlying physiological sleepiness. The MSLT consists of four to five naps given 2h apart during the day, following a standardized procedure. The mean sleep latency from all naps is used as the measure of sleepiness. The test has been shown to be valid and reliable and is part of the diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. However, the MSLT is affected by numerous variables including insufficient sleep, drugs, activity, and arousal level. Adherence to the established protocol is necessary to limit the effect of these extraneous factors on the MSLT. While the test is a valuable and widely used diagnostic tool for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, the use of MSLT in other sleep disorders is not well established.",2019.0

In this mini-review, we summarized EDS features in CNS hypersomnias to provide a guide for differential diagnosis purposes.

A review of recent literature was performed to provide an update in CNS hypersomnias.

At clinical evaluation, narcolepsy patients report a good restorative potential of sleep together with the frequent occurrence of dreaming even during short-lasting naps. These features are mirrored by the neurophysiological evidence of REM sleep at sleep onset (SOREMP) during the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), a specific marker. Conversely, patients with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) complain sleep inertia and prolonged nocturnal sleep. Polysomnographic studies show high sleep propensity on the MSLT or high 24-h total sleep time during continuous monitoring. Patients with insufficient sleep syndrome (ISS) can present with variable clinical EDS features in between narcolepsy and IH. ISS diagnosis is based on the clinical evidence of nocturnal sleep curtailment (weekdays versus vacations) associated with the disappearance of EDS complaint after sleep extension. Polysomnographic data are not required, but when the MSLT is performed, ISS patients can present with SOREMP arising from non-REM stage 2 sleep (vs narcolepsy patients entering into SOREM most frequently from wakefulness). Kleine-Levin Syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of enormously prolonged sleep time lasting days associated with abnormal cognition and behavior intermixed by asymptomatic periods, a sleep pattern that can be well documented by actigraphy.

Different CNS hypersomnias present with specific features of EDS are useful to guide the clinician to apply and interpret appropriate neurophysiological investigations.",2020.0

Incidence for narcolepsy without cataplexy was generally several times higher than narcolepsy with cataplexy. Prevalence and incidence were approximately 50% greater for females compared to males across most age groups. Prevalence was highest among the 21-30 years age group, with incidence highest among enrollees in their early 20s and late teens. Regionally, the North Central United States had the highest prevalence and incidence, whereas the West was the lowest.

We found greater prevalence and incidence of narcolepsy (including without cataplexy) than most previous studies. The increased proportions in females, enrollees in their early 20s, and US regional differences require further study. Increased awareness and early identification is critical in the management of this burdensome condition.",2019.0
30803831,The role of home sleep testing for evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness: focus on obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy.,Rosenberg R; Hirshkowitz M; Rapoport DM; Kryger M,2019 Apr,Sleep medicine,"Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common complaint in the general population, which may be associated with a wide range of sleep disorders and other medical conditions. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized primarily by EDS, which involves a substantial burden of illness but is often overlooked or misdiagnosed. In addition to identifying low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin (orexin) levels, evaluation for narcolepsy requires in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). Polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as well as other sleep disorders. However, the use of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) to screen for OSA in adults with EDS has increased greatly based on its lower cost, lower technical complexity, and greater convenience, versus PSG. The most commonly used, types 3 and 4, portable monitors for HSAT lack capability for electroencephalogram recording, which is necessary for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders and is provided by PSG. These limitations, combined with the increased use of HSAT for evaluation of EDS, may further exacerbate the under-recognition of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias, either as primary or comorbid disorders with OSA. Adherence to expert consensus guidelines for use of HSAT is essential. Differential clinical characteristics of patients with narcolepsy and OSA may help guide correct diagnosis. Continued EDS in patients diagnosed and treated for OSA may indicate comorbid narcolepsy or another sleep disorder. Although HSAT may diagnose OSA in appropriately selected patients, it cannot rule out or diagnose narcolepsy. Therefore, at present, PSG and MSLT remain the cornerstone for narcolepsy diagnosis.",2019.0

Here, we report a small case series of four narcolepsy patients seen over a four year period in the sleep clinic of a tertiary care hospital in north India. The diagnosis was established by clinical history and two or more sleep-onset rapid eye movements (SOREMs) on multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) following overnight polysomnography (PSG). The mean age of patients was 26.2±6.4 yr; one patient had associated cataplexy and another one had all four cardinal symptoms of narcolepsy. All these patients had a history of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The mean body mass index was 24.2±4.7 kg/m[2]. The mean sleep latency during MSLT was 2.7±1.3 min, and the mean REM latency was 5.7±2.9 min. Narcolepsy, although rarely reported from India, should be suspected in young non-obese patients complaining of EDS and confirmed by performing MSLT following overnight PSG.",2018.0
30649557,Sleepiness and sleepiness perception in patients with Parkinson's disease: a clinical and electrophysiological study.,Bargiotas P; Lachenmayer ML; Schreier DR; Mathis J; Bassetti CL,2019 Apr 1,Sleep,"The main objective of the study was to assess the prevalence, the severity, and the daytime course of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and to explore how people with PD perceive the degree and onset of their sleepiness during objective sleepiness tests. In addition, the occurrence of early-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (sleep-onset REM periods [SOREMPs]) in PD was assessed.

We analyzed data from 46 people with PD (26 males, mean age 63.5 years, mean UPDRS-III-OFF 34.7). The sleep-wake assessment included Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), and objective (polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test [MSLT], and maintenance of wakefulness tests [MWT]) measures.

Subjective (ESS ≥ 10) and objective (mean sleep latency, MSL < 5 min in MSLT) EDS were present in 43% and 41% of patients, respectively. The MSL in MSLT and MWT remained unchanged throughout the day and significantly correlated with KSS during the trial but not with KSS shortly before it. In MWT, about one-fourth of patients failed to signal their sleepiness before falling asleep. SOREMPs, usually (83%) arising from NREM1 or wake, were recorded in 24% of the patients. People with SOREMPs had significantly lower MSL in MSLT and MWT and higher AHI compared with those without SOREMPs.

Patients with PD exhibit daylong increased EDS but they underestimate its degree and often fail to signal its onset. SOREMPs in PD have a ""narcoleptic"" character in sleep-stage sequencing and are associated with the presence of sleep-disturbed breathing. These results add to our understanding of sleepiness and sleepiness perception in PD and have important implications for its diagnosis and management.",2019.0
30579702,Narcolepsy and 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccination in Taiwan.,Huang WT; Huang YS; Hsu CY; Chen HC; Lee HC; Lin HC; Hsieh CF; Wu MN; Yang CH,2020 Feb,Sleep medicine,"Several European countries have observed an association between narcolepsy and H1N1 vaccines containing AS03® adjuvant in children/adolescents. In Taiwan, a nationwide campaign starting November 2009 administered H1N1 vaccines without adjuvant or with MF59® adjuvant to 67% of children and 12% of adults.

For those registered in the 2000-2012 National Health Insurance (NHI) databases, we compared age-stratified (0-4, 5-18, 19-59, and ≥60 years) incidence of first referral for a diagnostic MSLT for the pre-pandemic, pandemic/pre-vaccination, and vaccination/post-pandemic period. We also compared the odds of H1N1 vaccination in each chart-ascertained narcolepsy patient, whoever had an onset of excessive daytime sleepiness between April 2009 and December 2012, with 10 population-based controls from the NHI databases on year of birth, sex, and index date, using conditional logistic regressions.

Incidence of MSLT referral for narcolepsy was highest and significantly increased in the pandemic/pre-vaccination period in the age group 5-18 (IRR 3.40, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.12-5.45) and 19-59 (IRR 2.90, 95% CI 1.62-5.02) years. Among 137 confirmed narcolepsy cases (86 adults and 51 children), the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.67 (95% CI 0.81-3.45) (adults) and 1.22 (95% CI 0.62-2.39) (children) for H1N1 vaccination without adjuvant, and 1.39 (95% CI 0.17-11.48) (adults) and 3.66 (95% CI 0.37-36.02) (children) with MF59® adjuvant.

No substantial association between the use of H1N1 vaccines and narcolepsy was identified in Taiwan. Instead, the H1N1 infection itself could have played a role in triggering narcolepsy in children and young adults.",2020.0
30523556,A false alarm of narcolepsy: obstructive sleep apnea masquerading as narcolepsy and depression.,Paudel D; Lin Q; Yan C; Liu S; Zhang B,2019 Sep,Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,"We report a case with symptoms and signs of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression, and narcolepsy. Polysomnographic (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) findings, clinical characteristics, and diagnostic challenges in this case are discussed.

A 23-year-old single male presented with excessive daytime sleepiness, low mood, lack of energy, and snoring for 3 years. In addition, he reported excessive weight gain, lack of interest in work, partial loss of muscle tone during excitations, and sleep attacks during work and driving. He had experienced three episodes of sleep paralysis. The patient underwent a sleep study including PSG and MSLT.

On baseline PSG, he had an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 72.8/h. The MSLT showed a mean sleep latency of 3.8 min and two sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs). On admission, he had an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 21, and positive findings for depression in the clinical interview and psychometric scales. He was treated with continuous positive airway pressure without any medication. Follow-up PSG and MSLT were performed after 1 week, which showed an AHI of 0/h without SOREMPs. After 1 month, there was no sign of depression.

This study reflects that OSA can present with cataplexy-like features and false positive MSLT results for narcolepsy, as well as depressive symptoms. The case highlights the complexity in which OSA can present to physicians, and emphasizes that clinicians should be aware that OSA can mimic narcolepsy and present with depressive symptoms.",2019.0
30508781,Disease-specific attention impairment in disorders of chronic excessive daytime sleepiness.,Ramm M; Boentert M; Lojewsky N; Jafarpour A; Young P; Heidbreder A,2019 Jan,Sleep medicine,"Patients with chronic excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) complain of substantial attention deficits. However, their underlying neuronal dysfunction is largely unknown. Previous studies showed similar attention performances in central disorders of hypersomnolence suggesting that EDS-related cognitive impairment is independent of its cause. The aim of the current study was to further explore attentional profiles in disorders of chronic EDS.

Ten patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1; age 26.7 ± 9.3 years), 14 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH; age 26.7 ± 9.3 years), 14 patients with subjective EDS (sEDS; age 31.4 ± 14.3 years), ie, a mean sleep latency >8 min in the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and 20 healthy controls (HC; age 32.6 ± 11.3 years) performed the vigilance task and the selective attention task of the test battery SLEEP® (Vienna Test System Neuro®). We assessed mean response time (RT) and standard deviation of RT separately for the first and the second half of the vigilance task to evaluate performance changes over time (time on task effect; TOT).

A significant interaction effect between group and TOT on the mean RT in the vigilance task suggests partly group-specific attention deficits. Combining paradigms of sustained and selective attention discriminated patients with NT1, IH, sEDS and HC. Behavioral results were unrelated to the mean sleep latency in the MSLT.

Discriminative performance of the sustained and selective attention tasks indicate disease-specific components of attention in NT1, IH, and sEDS. Different temporal dynamics of attentional control efficiency might be one factor underlying group differences.",2019.0

Its physiological correlate is an unusual occurrence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, i.e., sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Various symptoms of the phenomenon are explained by the mechanisms of REM sleep. SOREMPs can be observed in various situations, which indicate a lower amplitude of circadian rhythms, such as during interupted sleep, acute reversal of sleep and wakefulness cycle, and disrupted sleep of depressive patients and in newborn babies. The lifetime prevalence of the phenomenon in the general population is as high about 40%. The phenomenon can be a mysterious and frightening experience far affected people and called as various names according to the folklore beliefs of local communities, e.g., nightmare in Europe, hexendrücken in Germany, cauchemar in France, and old hag in Newfoundland. Japanese college students are known for their very short sleep length and disturbed sleep wake rhythms. Many students claim to have experienced daytime sleepiness. Some of them meet the criterion concerning sleep latencies and frequency of SOREMPs for multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) as narcolepsy. SOREMPs are frequently seen in healthy college students with certain lifestyles. Practitioners should be cautious to diagnose narcolepsy if the student shows disturbed sleep wake schedules.",2018.0
29351827,Nocturnal REM Sleep Without Atonia Is a Diagnostic Biomarker of Pediatric Narcolepsy.,Bin-Hasan S; Videnovic A; Maski K,2018 Feb 15,Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,"Compare nocturnal REM sleep without atonia (nRWA) and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) between pediatric patients with and without narcolepsy and determine if the nRWA index is a valid diagnostic biomarker for narcolepsy.

Retrospective cohort study of children ages 6 to 18 years who completed a nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Our study sample included 11 patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), 6 with narcolepsy type 2 (NT2), 12 with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), and 11 with subjective hypersomnia (sHS). We compared group nRWA indices (epochs of RWA/total stage R sleep epochs) from the nocturnal PSGs and analyzed nRWA index receiver operating curve (ROC) statistics for narcolepsy diagnosis.

The median nRWA index of patients with NT1 was 15 to 30 times higher compared to sHS and IH (Ps < .005) but similar to that of the NT2 group (P = .46). RBD was present in 25% of patients with narcolepsy (NT1 and NT2). In comparing those with and without narcolepsy, the nRWA index area under the curve was 0.87 (0.6), 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75 to 0.99, P < .001. The threshold of having ≥ 1% of stage R sleep epochs with nRWA yielded a sensitivity of 88.2%, 95% CI = 63.6-98.5 and specificity of 60.9%, 95% CI = 38.5 to 80.3 for diagnosis of narcolepsy. In contrast, a threshold of ≥ 8% yielded a specificity of 95.7%, 95% CI = 78.1 to 99.9 and sensitivity of 52.9%, 95% CI = 27.8 to 77.

The nRWA index is a very good diagnostic biomarker of pediatric narcolepsy. Depending on the clinical cutoffs utilized, this biomarker can identify more children/adolescents with narcolepsy using just the PSG or reduce false-positive diagnostic results.",2018.0

Repeatability of the MSLT was retrospectively evaluated in NT1 (n = 60) and NT2 (n = 54) cases, and controls (n = 15). All subjects had documented HLA-DQB1*06:02 status and/or hypocretin-1 levels from cerebrospinal fluid. All subjects had undergone 2 MSLTs (≥ 1 meeting ICSD-3 criteria for narcolepsy). Repeatability was explored in children versus adults and in those on versus not on medication(s). Subsample and multivariate analysis were performed.

Both MSLTs in unmedicated patients were positive for narcolepsy in 78%, 18%, and 7% of NT1, NT2, and controls, respectively. NT2 cases changed to idiopathic hypersomnia or to a negative MSLT 26% and 57% of the time, respectively. Although NT1 cases were 10 to 14 times more likely to demonstrate a second positive MSLT compared to NT2 cases (P < 10-5) and controls (P < 10-4), respectively, NT2 cases were not significantly different from controls (P = .64). Medication use (P = .009) but not adult versus children status (P = .85) significantly decreased the likelihood of a repeat positive MSLT.

In a clinical setting, a positive MSLT for narcolepsy is a more reproducible and stable feature in NT1 than NT2. The retrospective design of this study hinders interpretation of these data, as there are many different, and possibly opposing, reasons to repeat a MSLT in NT1 versus NT2 (ie, ascertainment bias). Additional systematic MSLT repeatability studies independent of confounds are ideally needed to confirm these findings.",2018.0

Several studies demonstrated its association with HLA-DQB1*0602 in various ethnic groups. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of HLA-DQB1*0602 allele in Iranian patients with narcolepsy and assess its predictive parameters for diagnosing narcolepsy. In addition, car accidents and job problems were assessed among narcoleptic patients. We studied 44 narcoleptic patients, 30 patients with other types of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)  and 50 healthy age and sex matched individuals in this case-control study. Patients and controls filled out a questionnaire including items about car accidents due to sleepiness and job problems. International classification of sleep disorders-2 criteria was used as the gold standard for diagnosis of narcolepsy. The DNAs isolated from whole blood samples were collected from the patients and controls to assess the presence of HLA-DQB1*0602. The results showed that HLA DQB1*0602 was present in 4 (8%) individual of controls and 20 (45.5%) patients with higher prevalence in patients with cataplexy (78.9%) than patients without cataplexy (p<0.001). The sensitivities of the DQB1*0602 for diagnosing narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy were 78.9 and 20; specificities were 88 and 72.4, respectively. 18.2% of patients had car accidents due to sleepiness and 68.2% suffered from job problems. Our study shows that evaluation of DQB1*0602 in patients suspected to narcolepsy could be helpful especially in complex cases with atypical cataplexy and indistinguishable multiple sleep latency test MSLT results. Moreover, high rates of car accidents and job problems are found among narcoleptic patients.",2017.0

At the first PSG-MSLT, patients with NCHS were classified as having NT2 (22.7%), IH (26.7%), or UnsEDS (50.6%). A positive PSG-MSLT was confirmed in 72.7% of NT1. The classification consistency at retesting was significantly lower for the NT2 (47.1%), IH (25.0%), and UnsEDS (42.1%) categories than NT1 (81.3%). The between-test mean sleep latency (MSL) variability was significantly different in NT1 and NCHS, with higher changes in NT2 and lower in NT1. A longer test-retest interval was associated with improved MSL and MSLT normalization. Between-test variations in SOREMP number were associated with changes in nocturnal REM sleep parameters and MSL. No association was found with the clinical decision to repeat the evaluation or the disease clinical course.

The PSG-MSLT measures and classification are not stable in patients with NCHS, with frequent diagnostic changes, particularly for NT2 and IH, compared with NT1. MSLT needs to be repeated at regular intervals to confirm a stable hypersomnia and provide an accurate diagnosis of NT2 and IH.",2017.0

These false positives are common, may create diagnostic uncertainty, and highlight the need for complementary MSLT measures with high specificity for NC.

Detailed analysis of MSLT findings in 56 NC, 83 PD, 89 SDB, and 23 ISS patients, using receiver operating characteristic curves.

A positive MSLT (mean sleep latency ≤ 8.0 minutes and ≥2 SOREMPs) was found in 53 NC (95%), 1 PD (1%), 8 SDB (9%), and 12 ISS patients (52%). MSLT-based differentiation between NC and non-NC patients was best when applying a mean R latency of ≤5 minutes (sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value [PPV]: 49%/95%/96%) or a mean percentage of sleep stage R ≥ 40% (sensitivity/specificity/PPV: 60%/100%/100%) as cutoffs. When analyzing all 252 naps with SOREMPs in isolation, the combination of both R latency of ≤5 minutes and R percentage of ≥50% yielded a sensitivity/specificity/PPV of 50%/99%/99%. In addition, a sleep stage sequence with R occurring prior to N2 was more common in NC than in non-NC (71% vs. 32%, p < .001), and in combination with R percentage of ≥50% yielded a sensitivity/specificity/PPV of 53%/96%/97%.

A better characterization of R sleep by latency, duration, and sleep stage sequence facilitates detection of false positives and, hence, contributes to a higher MSLT specificity in NC.",2017.0

Fortyfour patients: 15 with narcolepsy type 1, 14 with hypersomnia associated with a psychiatric disorder and 15 age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study. The study subjects filled in the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The severity of daytime sleepiness was quantified subjectively using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), and objectively using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). All subjects underwent polysomnography (PSG) on the two consecutive nights. The data from the second night was analysed. The slow wave activity (SWA, 1-4 Hz) was calculated for the three consecutive sleep cycles, and topographic delta power maps were plotted. In contrast to narcoleptics, psychiatric hypersomniacs had undisturbed nocturnal sleep, high sleep efficiency, normal non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep proportions, normal REM latency and sleep latencies on MSLT and PSG. The subjective and objective sleepiness was significantly higher in narcolepsy group than in psychiatric hypersomnia group. In all the study groups SWA was the most prominent in frontal areas, while the greatest between-group differences were found in the central areas. There were significant differences between the groups in SWA in the second NREM episode. The highest SWA was observed in the hypersomnia group, while the lowest in the narcolepsy group. Psychiatric hypersomniacs and controls did not differ in the SWA exponential decline over consecutive NREM episodes, whereas narcoleptics exhibited a steeper dissipation of sleep pressure from the first to the second NREM episode. In conclusion, narcolepsy type1 and hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorder differ in the SWA dynamics.

After being diagnosed with a NT1 the patient was treated with modafinil and sodium oxybate. She was hospitalized for psychotic symptoms after starting NT1 treatment. Withdrawal of the narcolepsy treatment and initiation of haloperidol 1 mg/day (the only antipsychotic treatment she could tolerate) improved the delusions, hallucinations and dysphoria but worsened the narcolepsy symptoms. Polysomnography showed fragmented nocturnal sleep and five sleep REM onset periods in MSLT. Positive HLA-QB1*06:02 and undetectable level of hypocretine in the cerebrospinal fluid were found. MRI and CT-scan were normal. Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies Adapted for Narcolepsy (DIGSAN) questionnaire confirmed that patient presented a dual diagnostic NT1 and psychotic symptoms.

She currently has severe somnolence, obesity, and partial cataplectic attacks along with normal mood, academic failure and social isolation.

The coexistence of narcolepsy with psychoses is a rare clinical entity, more frequent in adolescents than in adults. The comorbidity of the two illnesses worsens clinical and therapeutic prognosis and also suggests interesting pathophysiological hypotheses.",2017.0
28522102,Retrospective multicenter matched case-control study on the risk factors for narcolepsy with special focus on vaccinations (including pandemic influenza vaccination) and infections in Germany.,Oberle D; Pavel J; Mayer G; Geisler P; Keller-Stanislawski B; German Narcolepsy Study Group,2017 Jun,Sleep medicine,"Studies associate pandemic influenza vaccination with narcolepsy. In Germany, a retrospective, multicenter, matched case-control study was performed to identify risk factors for narcolepsy, particularly regarding vaccinations (seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination) and infections (seasonal and pandemic influenza) and to quantify the detected risks.

Patients with excessive daytime sleepiness who had been referred to a sleep center between April 2009 and December 2012 for multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were eligible. Case report forms were validated according to the criteria for narcolepsy defined by the Brighton Collaboration (BC). Confirmed cases of narcolepsy (BC level of diagnostic certainty 1-4a) were matched with population-based controls by year of birth, gender, and place of residence. A second control group was established including patients in whom narcolepsy was definitely excluded (test-negative controls).

A total of 103 validated cases of narcolepsy were matched with 264 population-based controls. The second control group included 29 test-negative controls. A significantly increased odd ratio (OR) to develop narcolepsy (crude OR [cOR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8-8.5; adjusted OR [aOR] = 4.5, 95% CI = 2.0-9.9) was detected in individuals immunized with pandemic influenza A/H1N1/v vaccine prior to symptoms onset as compared to nonvaccinated individuals. Using test-negative controls, in individuals immunized with pandemic influenza A/H1N1/v vaccine prior to symptoms onset, a nonsignificantly increased OR of narcolepsy was detected when compared to nonvaccinated individuals (whole study population, BC levels 1-4a: cOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.5-6.9; aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 0.3-10.1).

The findings of this study support an increased risk for narcolepsy after immunization with pandemic influenza A/H1N1/v vaccine.",2017.0
28471950,Comparison of Sleep Latency and Number of SOREMPs in the Home and Hospital With a Modified Multiple Sleep Latency Test: A Randomized Crossover Study.,Beiske KK; Sand T; Rugland E; Stavem K,2017 May,Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,"Comparison of mean sleep latencies and number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) between modified multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) performed in the unattended home and in-hospital laboratory setting.

A randomized crossover single-blinded design. Thirty-four subjects referred to MSLT for suspected hypersomnia or narcolepsy were included. Participants were randomized to perform modified MSLT in the unattended home or in the hospital first. Scores in the two settings were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test or exact McNemar test. Agreement between home and hospital categorized mean sleep latency and number of SOREMPs was assessed using simple kappa (κ) and proportion agreement. Agreement between home and hospital mean sleep latency was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot and an intraclass correlation coefficient.

There was no difference between home and hospital assessment of mean sleep latency (P = 0.86). Two or more SOREMPs were found more frequently on modified MSLTs performed at home compared with those at the hospital (7 and 2, respectively; P = 0.025). Agreement was moderate for categorized sleep latency (κ = 0.53) and fair for categorized SOREMPs (κ = 0.39) in the 2 settings. Analysis of mean sleep latency using intraclass correlation coefficient showed a very good agreement between the two settings.

Group mean sleep latency for home modified MSLTs seems to be reliable compared with that for the attended sleep-laboratory setting. Higher rate of SOREMP in the unattended home suggests that napping in a familiar environment facilitates the transition into REM sleep. Further studies are needed to assess the normal limit, sensitivity, and specificity for SOREMP at home before the clinical utility of home-based napping can be determined.",2017.0
28366327,Underutilization of the MSLT in sleepy patients with a short onset REM period (SOREMP) in the sleep clinic.,Cairns A; Bogan R,2017 Apr,Sleep medicine,"A nocturnal sleep onset REM period (defined as REM onset latency ≤ 15 min; SOREMP) occurs rarely and research has shown that the phenomenon is specific for type 1 and 2 narcolepsy. However, little is known about the meaningfulness of the phenotype in general sleep clinic patients because those that exhibit the phenomenon often present with few traditional narcolepsy symptoms. As such, this study aimed to (1) evaluate the rate of eventual MSLT testing for those with a SOREMP on routine PSG when the phenomenon occurred in the absence of potential explanatory factors and (2) quantify the stability of the SOREMP phenotype.

This was a retrospective analysis of a large repository of de-identified PSG and MSLT test results from 2008 to 2015. Patient records were retrieved from a repository of studies completed at a variety of sleep laboratories across the USA. A total of 118,046 baseline polysomnograms were evaluated for a PSG SOREMP (occurred in 0.7% of the sample). Patients were excluded if they indicated working either shift or night work at the time of the SOREMP or if their self-reported habitual weekday time in bed was less than 7 h. A final sample of 391 cases with a SOREMP were sequestered and previous or consecutive studies were searched for each individual.

The vast majority of patients (n = 347/391; 89%) with a PSG SOREMP never received MSLT testing. Patients that were evaluated by MSLT (n = 44; 11%) were typically very sleepy and 82% ended up with a diagnosis of narcolepsy or had MSLTs consistent with current narcolepsy criteria (ie, including the nocturnal SOREMP). Only seven of the 140 patients (n = 5%) that with OSA that first underwent one or more PAP titrations were subsequently seen for an MSLT. Compared to those that eventually received an MSLT, patients that did not receive MSLT testing were older (52 vs. 41 years, p < 0.001), more likely to have moderate to severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15; 39% vs. 16%, p < 0.001), and were generally less likely to report severe sleepiness (ESS ≥ 16; 25% vs. 55%, p < 0.001) and vehicle or workplace accidents or injuries. However, 12% of those that never received an MSLT reported such extreme sleepiness that they endorsed a near-miss car accident due to sleepiness, almost twice as prevalent than that found in a random sample of matched moderate-to-severe OSA patients (p < 0.01). Overall, the reliability of the SOREMP phenotype was low at 9.8%, but was much higher for those diagnosed with type 2 narcolepsy (31%) compared to those without narcolepsy (IH or normal MSLTs; 0%; p < 0.01) or where narcolepsy status was unknown because an MSLT was not conducted (7%; p < 0.01).

The MSLT has been historically underutilized for those exhibiting a SOREMP on diagnostic PSG, a potential marker of narcolepsy. This is presumably because patients with a PSG SOREMP reported variable levels of sleepiness (although some severe) and many had some degree of OSA, which may either be a partial factor in symptomology or even obscure true narcolepsy. Some patients with a PSG SOREMP were very sleepy and most, when an MSLT was conducted, received a diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy despite few presenting with some of the associated features of narcolepsy. Well-controlled longitudinal studies with high quality data on cataplexy and hypocretin status are needed to understand where the PSG SOREMP phenomenon falls on the hypersomnolence spectrum and to establish which comorbidities share variance with and/or potentially mask narcolepsy. However because untreated narcolepsy can have high social, functional, and financial burden, until such studies are done, physicians should consider a narcolepsy workup when a SOREMP is observed (especially if multiple are seen) as well as close follow-up for symptom resolution when, for example, a patient is treated for sleep apnea.",2017.0
27855741,Normal Morning Melanin-Concentrating Hormone Levels and No Association with Rapid Eye Movement or Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Parameters in Narcolepsy Type 1 and Type 2.,Schrölkamp M; Jennum PJ; Gammeltoft S; Holm A; Kornum BR; Knudsen S,2017 Feb 15,Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,"Other than hypocretin-1 (HCRT-1) deficiency in narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), the neurochemical imbalance of NT1 and narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) with normal HCRT-1 levels is largely unknown. The neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is mainly secreted during sleep and is involved in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep regulation. Hypocretin neurons reciprocally interact with MCH neurons. We hypothesized that altered MCH secretion contributes to the symptoms and sleep abnormalities of narcolepsy and that this is reflected in morning cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) MCH levels, in contrast to previously reported normal evening/afternoon levels.

Lumbar CSF and plasma were collected from 07:00 to 10:00 from 57 patients with narcolepsy (subtypes: 47 NT1; 10 NT2) diagnosed according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3) and 20 healthy controls. HCRT-1 and MCH levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay and correlated with clinical symptoms, polysomnography (PSG), and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) parameters.

CSF and plasma MCH levels were not significantly different between narcolepsy patients regardless of ICSD-3 subtype, HCRT-1 levels, or compared to controls. CSF MCH and HCRT-1 levels were not significantly correlated. Multivariate regression models of CSF MCH levels, age, sex, and body mass index predicting clinical, PSG, and MSLT parameters did not reveal any significant associations to CSF MCH levels.

Our study shows that MCH levels in CSF collected in the morning are normal in narcolepsy and not associated with the clinical symptoms, REM sleep abnormalities, nor number of muscle movements during REM or NREM sleep of the patients. We conclude that morning lumbar CSF MCH measurement is not an informative diagnostic marker for narcolepsy.",2017.0

We studied 71 young, type 1 narcoleptic patients and 20 sex- and age-matched control individuals using brain positron emission tomography (PET) images and neurocognitive testing. Clinical investigation was carried out using sleep-wake evaluation questionnaires; a sleep-wake study was conducted with actigraphy, polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and blood tests (with human leukocyte antigen typing). The continuous performance test (CPT) and Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) were administered on the same day as the PET study. PET data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (version 8) software. Correlation of brain imaging and neurocognitive function was performed by Pearson's correlation. Statistical analyses (Student's t-test) were conducted with SPSS version-18. Seventy-one narcoleptic patients (mean age: 16.15 years, 41 boys (57.7%)) and 20 controls (mean age: 15.1 years, 12 boys (60%)) were studied. Results from the CPT and WCST showed significantly worse scores in narcoleptic patients than in controls (P < 0.05). Compared to controls, narcoleptic patients presented with hypometabolism in the right mid-frontal lobe and angular gyrus (P < 0.05) and significant hypermetabolism in the olfactory lobe, hippocampus, parahippocampus, amygdala, fusiform, left inferior parietal lobe, left superior temporal lobe, striatum, basal ganglia and thalamus, right hypothalamus, and pons (P < 0.05) in the PET study. Changes in brain metabolic activity in narcoleptic patients were positively correlated with results from the sleepiness scales and performance tests. Young, type 1 narcoleptic patients face a continuous cognitive handicap. Our imaging cognitive test protocol can be useful for investigating the effects of treatment trials in these patients.",2016.0

Narcolepsy is uncommon, with a low prevalence rate which makes it difficult to diagnose definitively without a complex series of tests and a detailed history. The aim of this study was to review patients referred to a tertiary sleep centre who had been labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy prior to referral in order to assess if the diagnosis was accurate, and if not, to determine the cause of diagnostic misattribution.

All patients seen at a sleep centre from 2007-2013 (n = 551) who underwent detailed objective testing including an MSLT PSG, as well as wearing an actigraphy watch and completing a sleep diary for 2 weeks, were assessed for a pre-referral and final diagnosis of narcolepsy.

Of the 41 directly referred patients with a diagnostic label of narcolepsy, 19 (46 %) were subsequently confirmed to have narcolepsy on objective testing and assessment by a sleep physician using ICSD-2 criteria.

The diagnosis of narcolepsy was incorrectly attributed to almost 50 % of patients labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy who were referred for further opinion by a variety of specialists and generalists. Accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy is critical for many reasons, such as the impact it has on quality of life, driving, employment, insurance and pregnancy in women as well as medication management.",2016.0
27120092,No Evidence for Disease History as a Risk Factor for Narcolepsy after A(H1N1)pdm09 Vaccination.,Lamb F; Ploner A; Fink K; Maeurer M; Bergman P; Piehl F; Weibel D; Sparén P; Dahlström LA,2016,PloS one,"To investigate disease history before A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination as a risk factor for narcolepsy.

Case-control study in Sweden. Cases included persons referred for a Multiple Sleep Latency Test between 2009 and 2010, identified through diagnostic sleep centres and confirmed through independent review of medical charts. Controls, selected from the total population register, were matched to cases on age, gender, MSLT-referral date and county of residence. Disease history (prescriptions and diagnoses) and vaccination history was collected through telephone interviews and population-based healthcare registers. Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate disease history before A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination as a risk-factor for narcolepsy.

In total, 72 narcolepsy cases and 251 controls were included (range 3-69 years mean19-years). Risk of narcolepsy was increased in individuals with a disease history of nervous system disorders (OR range = 3.6-8.8) and mental and behavioural disorders (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.6-8.8) before referral. In a second analysis of vaccinated individuals only, nearly all initial associations were no longer statistically significant and effect sizes were smaller (OR range = 1.3-2.6). A significant effect for antibiotics (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) and a marginally significant effect for nervous system disorders was observed. In a third case-only analysis, comparing cases referred before vaccination to those referred after; prescriptions for nervous system disorders (OR = 26.0 95% CI 4.0-170.2) and ADHD (OR = 35.3 95% CI 3.4-369.9) were statistically significant during the vaccination period, suggesting initial associations were due to confounding by indication.

26864219,Which diagnostic findings in disorders with excessive daytime sleepiness are really helpful? A retrospective study.,Kretzschmar U; Werth E; Sturzenegger C; Khatami R; Bassetti CL; Baumann CR,2016 Jun,Journal of sleep research,"Due to extensive clinical and electrophysiological overlaps, the correct diagnosis of disorders with excessive daytime sleepiness is often challenging. The aim of this study was to provide diagnostic measures that help discriminating such disorders, and to identify parameters, which don't. In this single-center study, we retrospectively identified consecutive treatment-naïve patients who suffered from excessive daytime sleepiness, and analyzed clinical and electrophysiological measures in those patients in whom a doubtless final diagnosis could be made. Of 588 patients, 287 reported subjective excessive daytime sleepiness. Obstructive sleep apnea is the only disorder that could be identified by polysomnography alone. The diagnosis of insufficient sleep syndrome relies on actigraphy as patients underestimate their sleep need and the disorder shares several clinical and electrophysiological properties with both narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic hypersomnia. Sleep stage sequencing on MSLT appears helpful to discriminate between insufficient sleep syndrome and narcolepsy. Sleep inertia is a strong indicator for idiopathic hypersomnia. There are no distinctive electrophysiological findings for the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome. Altogether, EDS disorders are common in neurological sleep laboratories, but usually cannot be diagnosed based on PSG and MSLT findings alone. The diagnostic value of actigraphy recordings can hardly be overestimated.",2016.0

Totally 66 patients with narcolepsy who were conformed international classification of sleep disturbances (ICSD-2) diagnostic criteria treated with atomoxetine hydrochloride seen from November 2010 to December 2014 were enrolled into this study, 42 of them were male and 24 female, mean age of onset was 7.5 years (3.75-13.00 years), mean duration before diagnosis was 1.75 years (0.25-5.00 years). Complete blood count, liver and kidney function, multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), polysomnography (PGS), neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed for each patient. For some of the children HLA-DR2 gene and serum markers of infection were tested. The 66 cases were followed up from 2 to 49 months (average 18 months) to observe the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions.

In 62 cases excessive daytime sleepiness was improved, in 11 cases (16.7%) it was controlled (16.7%), in 29 cases (43.9%) the treatment was obviously effective and in 22 (33.3%) it was effective; cataplexy occurred in 54 cases, in 18 (33.3%) it was controlled, in 19 (35.2%) the treatment was obviously effective and in 10 (18.5%) effective; night sleep disorders existed in 55 cases, in 47 cases it was improved, in 14 (25.5%) it was controlled, in 20 (36.4%) the treatment was obviously effective and in 13 (23.6%) effective; hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucination was present in 13 cases, in only 4 these symptoms were controlled.

26599679,Idiopathic hypersomnia.,Billiard M; Sonka K,2016 Oct,Sleep medicine reviews,"Idiopathic hypersomnia continues to evolve from the concept of ""sleep drunkenness"" introduced by Bedrich Roth in Prague in 1956 and the description of idiopathic hypersomnia with two forms, polysymptomatic and monosymptomatic, by the same Bedrich Roth in 1976. The diagnostic criteria of idiopathic hypersomnia have varied with the successive revisions of the International classifications of sleep disorders, including the recent 3rd edition. No epidemiological studies have been conducted so far. Disease onset occurs most often during adolescence or young adulthood. A familial background is often present but rigorous studies are still lacking. The key manifestation is hypersomnolence. It is often accompanied by sleep of long duration and debilitating sleep inertia. Polysomnography (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is mandatory, as well as a 24 h PSG or a 2-wk actigraphy in association with a sleep log to ensure a total 24-h sleep time longer than or equal to 66O minutes, when the mean sleep latency on the MSLT is longer than 8 min. Yet, MSLT is neither sensitive nor specific and the polysomnographic diagnostic criteria require continuous readjustment and biologic markers are still lacking. Idiopathic hypersomnia is most often a chronic condition though spontaneous remission may occur. The condition is disabling, sometimes even more so than narcolepsy type 1 or 2. Based on neurochemical, genetic and immunological analyses as well as on exploration of the homeostatic and circadian processes of sleep, various pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed. Differential diagnosis involves a number of diseases and it is not yet clear whether idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy type 2 are not the same condition. Until now, the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia has mirrored that of the sleepiness of narcolepsy type 1 or 2. The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of modafinil have just been published, as well as a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of clarithromycine, a negative allosteric modulator of the γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor.",2016.0

In this study, performed in a tertiary sleep disorders centre, treatment responses were examined following these recommendations, and the ability of sleep-stage sequencing of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods in the multiple sleep latency test to predict treatment response. Over a 3.5-year period, 255 patients were retrospectively identified in the authors' database as patients diagnosed with narcolepsy, type 1 (with cataplexy) or type 2 (without) using clinical and polysomnographic criteria. Eligible patients were examined in detail, sleep study data were abstracted and sleep-stage sequencing of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods were analysed. Response to treatment was graded utilizing an internally developed scale. Seventy-five patients were included (39% males). Forty (53%) were diagnosed with type 1 narcolepsy with a mean follow-up of 2.37 ± 1.35 years. Ninety-seven percent of the patients were initially started on modafinil, and overall 59% reported complete response on the last follow-up. Twenty-nine patients (39%) had the sequence of sleep stage 1 or wake to rapid eye movement in all of their sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods, with most of these diagnosed as narcolepsy type 1 (72%). The presence of this specific sleep-stage sequence in all sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods was associated with worse treatment response (P = 0.0023). Sleep-stage sequence analysis of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods in the multiple sleep latency test may aid the prediction of treatment response in narcoleptics and provide a useful prognostic tool in clinical practice, above and beyond their classification as narcolepsy type 1 or 2.",2016.0

Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency (≤15 min) during nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) or during naps of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) defines a sleep-onset REM sleep period (SOREMP), a diagnostic hallmark. We hypothesized that abnormal sleep transitions other than SOREMPs can be identified in type 1 narcolepsy.

Sleep-stage transitions (one to 10 epochs to one to five epochs of any other stage) and bout length features (one to 10 epochs) were extracted from PSGs. The first 15 min of sleep were excluded when a nocturnal SOREMP was recorded. F(0.1) measures and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to identify specific (≥98%) features. A data set of 136 patients and 510 sex- and age-matched controls was used for the training. A data set of 19 cases and 708 sleep-clinic patients was used for the validation.

(1) ≥5 transitions from ≥5 epochs of stage N1 or W to ≥2 epochs of REM sleep, (2) ≥22 transitions from ≥3 epochs of stage N2 or N3 to ≥2 epochs of N1 or W, and (3) ≥16 bouts of ≥6 epochs of N1 or W were found to be highly specific (≥98%). Sensitivity ranged from 16% to 30%, and it did not vary substantially with and without medication or a nocturnal SOREMP. In patients taking antidepressants, nocturnal SOREMPs occurred much less frequently (16% vs. 36%, p < 0.001).

Increased sleep-stage transitions notably from ≥2.5 min of W/N1 into REM are specifically diagnostic for narcolepsy independent of a nocturnal SOREMP.",2015.0

The main aim of this study was to investigate the utility of SOREMP in differential diagnosis of central hypersomnias.

The authors retrospectively evaluated consecutive 101 patients with a normal polysomnography other than the presence of SOREMP and/or REM without atonia and a latency of ≤8 minutes in MSLT.

The authors classified patients as follows: 52 patients had at least 2 SOREMPs (narcolepsy group), 23 had no SOREMPs (idiopathic hypersomnia group), and 26 patients had only 1 SOREMP (intermediate group). In polysomnographic recordings, both mean sleep latency and REM latency were significantly shorter in the narcolepsy (P = 0.012, P < 0.001, respectively) and intermediate groups (P = 0.005 and P = 0.035, respectively) compared with the idiopathic hypersomnia group. In MSLT recordings, sleep latency was 2.7 ± 2.2 minutes in the narcolepsy group, 3.6 ± 1.4 minutes in the intermediate group, and 5.2 ± 2.7 minutes in the idiopathic hypersomnia group (P < 0.001). The mean REM latency and sleep stages SOREMPs arised from were similar between the narcolepsy and intermediate groups.

To date, SOREMPs in MSLT and polysomnography remain the sole electrodiagnostic feature that discriminates narcolepsy without cataplexy from idiopathic hypersomnia. Different parameters or combined criteria are being increasingly investigated to increase the sensitivity and specificity of MSLT. The findings showed an altered instability of REM sleep not only in patients with 2 or more SOREMPs in MSLT but also in patients with one SOREMP.",2015.0

Our goal was to study phenotypic expression across ethnicities in the United States.

Cases of narcolepsy from 1992 to 2013 were identified from searches of the Stanford Center for Narcolepsy Research database. International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition diagnosis criteria for type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy were used for inclusion, but subjects were separated as with and without cataplexy for the purpose of data presentation. Information extracted included demographics, ethnicity and clinical data, HLA-DQB1*06:02, polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) data, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 level.

182 African-Americans, 839 Caucasians, 35 Asians, and 41 Latinos with narcolepsy.

Sex ratio, PSG, and MSLT findings did not differ across ethnicities. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was higher and age of onset of sleepiness earlier in African Americans compared with other ethnicities. HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity was higher in African Americans (91.0%) versus others (76.6% in Caucasians, 80.0% in Asians, and 65.0% in Latinos). CSF hypocretin-1 level, obtained in 222 patients, was more frequently low (≤ 110 pg/ml) in African Americans (93.9%) versus Caucasians (61.5%), Asians (85.7%) and Latinos (75.0%). In subjects with low CSF hypocretin-1, African Americans (28.3%) were 4.5 fold more likely to be without cataplexy when compared with Caucasians (8.1%).

Narcolepsy in African Americans is characterized by earlier symptom onset, higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, higher HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity, and low cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 level in the absence of cataplexy.

Early recognition of pediatric narcolepsy is essential for growth and development. We experienced a case of narcolepsy in a three-year-old girl.

The patient underwent brain MRI and 24h video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. Polysomnography (PSG) with multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ typing was performed.

The brain MRI was normal. 24h video-EEG monitoring revealed no abnormal slow or epileptiform discharge on interictal EEG, and no EEG change during tongue thrusting, dropping head with laughter, or flopping down, which was consistent with cataplexy associated with narcolepsy. A mean sleep latency of 2.5 min and four episodes of sleep-onset REM periods in five naps were observed in PSG with MSLT. She was positive in HLA-DQB1*0602. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as narcoleptic with cataplexy.

The history, combined with PSG and MSLT, was helpful in the diagnosis of narcolepsy. We report a case of early-onset narcolepsy presenting with excessive sleepiness and cataplexy.",2016.0
26065128,"[Multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test and suggestive immobilization test].",Tanaka H,2015 Jun,Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine,"In clinical practice, assessment usually involves self-report; however, objective measures are available. The multiple sleep latency test(MSLT) is performed during the main period of wakefulness and is designed to determine a patient's propensity to fall asleep. To be valid, the MSLT should be performed the day after nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). It is the standard test for the assessment of objective sleepiness and diagnosis of narcolepsy, that is a mean sleep latency equal to or under 8 minutes and equal to or greater than two sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs). As opposed to the MSLT, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) is designed to test the patient's ability to stay awake. The MWT is a 40-minutes protocol consisting of four trials separated by 2-hour intervals and is performed in much the same way as the MSLT. The MWT may be indicated in assessment of individuals in whom the inability to remain awake constitutes a safety issue, or in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia to assess response to treatment with medications. There is little evidence linking mean sleep latency on the MWT with risk of accidents in real world circumstances. The suggestive immobilization test(SIT) was designed during which sensor and motor symptoms of restless legs syndrome are quantified during a period of immobility taking place in the evening before PSG. The patient is instructed to avoid moving voluntary for the entire duration of the test, which is designed to last 1 hour. The subjective leg discomfort evaluation and periodic leg movement by surface electromyograms from right and left anterior tibialis support diagnosis for restless legs syndrome. Many factors, such as clinical setting, pretest condition or aging effects etc. can alter the findings of the test and considerable clinical judgment is needed to avoid an error in interpretation. Above those three sleep-wake related tests provide us useful information.",2015.0
26039966,Prevalence and Clinical Correlates of a Short Onset REM Period (SOREMP) during Routine PSG.,Cairns A; Bogan R,2015 Oct 1,Sleep,"The objectives of this study were to quantify the (1) sensitivity and specificity of nocturnal PSG SOREMP (REM latency ≤ 15 min) for narcolepsy in those being evaluated for hypersomnolence and (2) prevalence and predictors of SOREMP during baseline PSG for patients being evaluated for various sleep disorders.

This was a retrospective analysis of a large repository of de-identified PSG and MSLT test results from 2007 to 2013.

Patient records were retrieved from a repository of studies completed at a variety of sleep laboratories across the USA. Included in the analyses were 79,651 general sleep clinic patients (without an MSLT; 48% male; 72% Caucasian) and an additional 3,059 patients (31.3% male; 72% Caucasian) being evaluated for hypersomnolence (with a consecutive MSLT).

NA.

For patients being evaluated for hypersomnolence, the prevalence of PSG SOREMP increased in a dose-response fashion with the number of REM onsets that occurred on a consecutive MSLT (0.5% for no MSLT SOREMPs to > 33.0% for those with 5 MSLT SOREMPs). Overall, having a PSG SOREMP was highly specific (99.5%; 95% CI: 99.1-99.7%) but not sensitive (6.7%; 95% CI: 4.7-9.2%) for narcolepsy. The prevalence of PSG SOREMP for patients in the general sleep clinic sample (i.e., not being evaluated by a consecutive MSLT) was 0.8% and was much higher in those that work night/swing shift. In adjusted models, African American race contributed to the most variance in PSG SOREMP.

A short onset rapid eye movement (REM) latency occurs rarely in general sleep clinic samples (< 1.0%), but is highly specific for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. Although rare, the prevalence of the phenomenon is much higher than the estimated prevalence of narcolepsy and may provide a critical opportunity for practitioners to identify narcolepsy in sleep clinic patients. These data also suggest that the utility of polysomnography (PSG) short onset REM peroid (SOREMP) for the diagnosis of narcolepsy may be altered by a history of shift/night work and/ or other factors that may allow for a rebound of REM sleep (e.g., undergoing a positive airway pressure titration), supporting published guidelines that other sleep disorders and insufficient and/or poorly timed sleep should be ruled out and/or adequately controlled for prior to conducting sleep testing. Further research is needed to understand racial differences in PSG SOREMP and narcolepsy. This study was limited in that data on cataplexy (with exception to that in final diagnosis) and habitual sleep duration were not available.",2015.0
26026626,Differences in electroencephalographic findings among categories of narcolepsy-spectrum disorders.,Sasai-Sakuma T; Inoue Y,2015 Aug,Sleep medicine,"To clarify the differences in quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) measures and their relation to clinical symptoms among narcolepsy-spectrum disorders.

The enrolled patients were: 28 with narcolepsy with cataplexy (NA-CA); 16 with NA without cataplexy (NA w/o CA) and HLA-DRB1*1501/DQB1*0602 positive (NA w/o CA HLA+); 22 with NA w/o CA and HLA negative (NA w/o CA HLA-); and 22 with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time (IHS w/o LST). Nocturnal polysomnography (n-PSG) and quantitative EEG evaluation, as well as the Multiple Sleep Latency test (MSLT), were conducted for all patients.

Patients with NA-CA or NA w/o CA HLA+ showed lower alpha power, higher delta and theta power during wakefulness, and higher alpha and beta power during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, compared to those with NA w/o CA HLA- or IHS w/o LST. The former two groups also showed lower sleep efficiency and a higher rate of positivity of REM-related symptoms than the other two groups.

In narcolepsy, the presence of cataplexy and HLA positivity are associated with EEG slowing during wakefulness and increased fast EEG activity during REM sleep, REM-related symptoms and disrupted nocturnal sleep in narcolepsy.",2015.0

To compare the baseline differences in the sleep stage transition to REM sleep among 35 patients with type 1 narcolepsy, 39 patients with type 2 narcolepsy, 26 unaffected relatives, and 159 non-narcoleptic sleep patient controls, followed by a reassessment at a mean duration of 37.4 months.

The highest prevalence of altered transition from stage non-N2/N3 to stage R in multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) was found in patients with type 1 narcolepsy (92.0% and 57.1%), followed by patients with type 2 narcolepsy (69.4% and 12.8%), unaffected relatives (46.2% and 0%), and controls (39.3% and 1.3%). Individual sleep variables had varied sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing narcolepsy. By incorporating a combination of sleep variables, the decision tree analysis improved the sensitivity to 94.3% and 82.1% and enhanced specificity to 82.4% and 83% for the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy, respectively. There was a significant association of DBQ1*0602 with the altered sleep stage transition (OR = 16.0, 95% CI: 1.7-149.8, p = 0.015). The persistence of the altered sleep stage transition in both MSLT and NPSG was high for both type 1 (90.5% and 64.7%) and type 2 narcolepsy (92.3% and 100%), respectively.

Altered sleep stage transition is a significant and stable marker of narcolepsy, which suggests a vulnerable wake-sleep dysregulation trait in narcolepsy. Altered sleep stage transition has a significant diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of hypersomnias, especially when combined with other diagnostic sleep variables in decision tree analysis.",2015.0

Cross-sectional.

Sleep laboratory.

One hundred seventy-five patients with hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, n = 79), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2, n = 22), idiopathic hypersomnia (IH, n = 22), and ""subjective"" hypersomnolence (sHS, n = 52).

None.

Polysomnographic (PSG) work-up included 48 h of continuous PSG recording. From nocturnal PSG conventional sleep macrostructure, occurrence of sleep onset rapid eye movement period (SOREMP), sleep stages distribution, and sleep stage transitions were calculated. Patient groups were compared, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to test the diagnostic utility of nocturnal PSG data to identify NT1.

Sleep macrostructure was substantially stable in the 2 nights of each diagnostic group. NT1 and NT2 patients had lower latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and NT1 patients showed the highest number of awakenings, sleep stage transitions, and more time spent in N1 sleep, as well as most SOREMPs at daytime PSG and at multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) than all other groups. ROC curve analysis showed that nocturnal SOREMP (area under the curve of 0.724 ± 0.041, P < 0.0001), percent of total sleep time spent in N1 (0.896 ± 0.023, P < 0.0001), and the wakefulness-sleep transition index (0.796 ± 0.034, P < 0.0001) had a good sensitivity and specificity profile to identify NT1 sleep, especially when used in combination (0.903 ± 0.023, P < 0.0001), similarly to SOREMP number at continuous daytime PSG (0.899 ± 0.026, P < 0.0001) and at MSLT (0.956 ± 0.015, P < 0.0001).

25554349,Polysomnographic and actigraphic characteristics of patients with H1N1-vaccine-related and sporadic narcolepsy.,Alakuijala A; Sarkanen T; Partinen M,2015 Jan,Sleep medicine,"After the pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine, Pandemrix©, was used in late 2009 and early 2010, the incidence of narcolepsy increased in many European countries. This incidence mainly increased in children and adolescents and, to a lesser degree, in adults.

125 unmedicated patients, aged 4 to 61 years, were included in this case-series study. Of these, 69 were diagnosed to have an H1N1-vaccine-related narcolepsy and 57 had sporadic narcolepsy. Most of these patients had: an actigraphy recording of 1-2 weeks, polysomnography, a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 concentration analysis.

Patients with H1N1-vaccine-related narcolepsy had shorter diagnostic delays, lower periodic leg movement index during sleep, earlier sleep-wake rhythm, and were younger in age at diagnosis, compared with sporadic cases. They also had shorter sleep latency and more sleep onset REM periods in MSLT, but these results were strongly age-dependent. Actigraphy showed quantitatively less sleep and more sleep fragmentation than polysomnography.

Regarding polysomnographic and actigraphic characteristics, there were no dramatic deviations between H1N1-vaccine-related and sporadic narcolepsy. Circadian rhythms indicated some interesting new findings with respect to the H1N1-vaccine-related disease. An actigraphy recording of 1-2 weeks is useful when studying the nocturnal aspects of narcolepsy and sleep-wake rhythms of narcoleptic patients.",2015.0
25377356,Sleepiness and performance is disproportionate in patients with non-organic hypersomnia in comparison to patients with narcolepsy and mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnoea.,Kofmel NC; Schmitt WJ; Hess CW; Gugger M; Mathis J,2014,Neuropsychobiology,"Clinical differentiation between organic hypersomnia and non-organic hypersomnia (NOH) is challenging. We aimed to determine the diagnostic value of sleepiness and performance tests in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) of organic and non-organic origin.

We conducted a retrospective comparison of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), pupillography, and the Steer Clear performance test in three patient groups complaining of EDS: 19 patients with NOH, 23 patients with narcolepsy (NAR), and 46 patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS).

As required by the inclusion criteria, all patients had Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores >10. The mean sleep latency in the MSLT indicated mild objective sleepiness in NOH (8.1 ± 4.0 min) and OSAS (7.2 ± 4.1 min), but more severe sleepiness in NAR (2.5 ± 2.0 min). The difference between NAR and the other two groups was significant; the difference between NOH and OSAS was not. In the Steer Clear performance test, NOH patients performed worst (error rate = 10.4%) followed by NAR (8.0%) and OSAS patients (5.9%; p = 0.008). The difference between OSAS and the other two groups was significant, but not between NOH and NAR. The pupillary unrest index was found to be highest in NAR (11.5) followed by NOH (9.2) and OSAS (7.4; n.s.).

A high error rate in the Steer Clear performance test along with mild sleepiness in an objective sleepiness test (MSLT) in a patient with subjective sleepiness (ESS) is suggestive of NOH. This disproportionately high error rate in NOH may be caused by factors unrelated to sleep pressure, such as anergia, reduced attention and motivation affecting performance, but not conventional sleepiness measurements.",2014.0

MSLT results were divided into those with (1) (-) urine drug screens, (2) urine drug screens (+) for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alone or THC plus other drugs, and (3) urine drug screens (+) for drugs other than THC. Groups were compared with Fisher exact tests or one-way ANOVA.

38 (10%) urine drug tests were (+): 14 for THC and 24 for other drugs. Forty-three percent of patients with drug screen (+) for THC had MSLT findings consistent with narcolepsy, 0% consistent with idiopathic hypersomnia, 29% other, and 29% normal. This was statistically different from those with (-) screens (24% narcolepsy, 20% idiopathic hypersomnia, 6% other, 50% normal), and those (+) for drugs other than THC (17% narcolepsy, 33% idiopathic hypersomnia, 4% other, 46% normal (p = 0.01).

Boston Children's Hospital sleep laboratory and outpatient clinics.

All patients 6-18 y old, referred for consecutive PSG and MSLT for the evaluation of central hypersomnias, between January 2005 and January 2014.

We analyzed the records of 148 patients and established diagnostic categories using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2(nd) Edition. Patient diagnoses included narcolepsy with cataplexy (28.4%), narcolepsy without cataplexy (8.1%), other hypersomnia conditions (9.5%), delayed sleep phase syndrome (12.2%), behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (4.1%), other sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements of sleep; 6.8%), isolated cataplexy (2%), and various diagnoses (29.1%). There were 54.8% of the N+C patients who had an nSOREMP, but only 2.4% of all other patients had an nSOREMP. The specificity of an nSOREMP for detection of N+C was high at 97.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.2-99.4%), but the sensitivity was moderate at 54.8% (95% CI: 38.7-70.2%). Overall, the positive predictive value of an nSOREMP for the diagnosis of N+C was 88.5% (95% CI: 69.8-97.4%).

Sixteen NC adult patients were recruited, together with 16 normal controls. Two consecutive PSG followed by two MSLT sessions were carried out, before and during the first night of SO assumption, respectively.

The administration of SO was followed by a significant decrease in number of stage shifts and awakenings, wakefulness after sleep onset, and percentage of sleep stage 1. Sleep efficiency and slow wave sleep percentage increased. REM latency decreased significantly from 73 to 12 min. Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) rate remained unchanged but the percentage of CAP A3 subtypes decreased. The number of CAP A3 subtypes per hour of NREM sleep decreased significantly, whereas that of A1 remained unchanged. The duration of A1 and A3 subtypes was slightly increased. Chin muscle tone was not modified by SO as well as periodic leg movements during sleep, but their periodicity index decreased, becoming similar to that of controls. MSLT sleep latency also significantly improved after SO intake.

The administration of SO in NC patients is followed by immediate important and complex effects on PSG parameters and MSLT, including an evident (over)increase in slow wave sleep, which does not display a physiological microstructure, a moderate decrease in periodic and isolated LMs, possibly mediated by a disinhibited dopaminergic neuronal activity, and an improvement on daytime mean sleep latency at the MSLT.",2014.0
24931392,Narcolepsy: let the patient's voice awaken us!,Flygare J; Parthasarathy S,2015 Jan,The American journal of medicine,"This is a “patient-centered” review about narcolepsy that aims to awaken the reader to the narcolepsy condition and to the trials and tribulations of patients with sleep problems in general. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder with a classic tetrad of symptoms consisting of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep onset hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The diagnosis of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders are often overlooked and could be attributed to other medical or even psychiatric conditions with years of missed diagnosis. Implementation of “two sleep-related questions” to the review of systems in the primary care physicians’ office visit may help address the issue of missed diagnosis and allow patients to seek prompt medical attention. Definitive diagnosis can be made by overnight sleep study followed by a nap test, “multiple sleep latency test” (MSLT). There is currently no cure for narcolepsy with the treatments addressing symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and nighttime sleep disruption with stimulants (modafinil, methylphenidate, and amphetamines), anti-cataplexy medications (Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and sedative-hypnotics including sodium oxybate. Narcolepsy, like other sleep disorders, can lead to marked reductions of health-related quality of life and affect patients’ social and work lives deleteriously. While traditional healthcare approaches are focused more on hard biomedical outcomes, a patient-centered approach with novel methods for better sleep assessment of patients, that can bypass the “impossibly crammed” physician office visit, would allow healthcare providers to better detect, diagnose and treat narcolepsy and other such sleep problems.",2015.0

Cross-sectional and longitudinal investigation of the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study.

Adults (44% females, 30-81 years) underwent NPSG (n = 4,866 in 1,518 subjects), and clinical MSLT (n = 1,135), with 823 having a repeat NPSG-MSLT at 4-year intervals, totaling 1725 NPSG with MSLT studies. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, and the stability of positive MSLTs was explored using κ statistics.

Prevalence of a nocturnal SOREMP on a NPSG, of ≥ 2 SOREMPs on the MSLT, of MSL ≤ 8 minutes on the MSLT, and of a positive MSLT (MSL ≤ 8 minutes plus ≥ 2 SOREMPs) were 0.35%, 7.0%, 22%, and 3.4%, respectively. Correlates of a positive MSLT were shift work (OR = 7.8, P = 0.0001) and short sleep (OR = 1.51/h, P = 0.04). Test-retest for these parameters was poor, with κ < 0.2 (n.s.) after excluding shift workers and short sleepers. Excluding shift-work, short sleep, and subjects with negative MSLTs, we found one undiagnosed subject with possible cataplexy (≥ 1/month) and a NPSG SOREMPs; one subject previously diagnosed with narcolepsy without cataplexy with 2 NPSG SOREMPs and a positive MSLT, and two subjects with 2 independently positive MSLTs (66% human leukocyte antigen [HLA] positive). The proportions for narcolepsy with and without cataplexy were 0.07% (95% CI: 0.02-0.37%) and 0.20% (95% CI: 0.07-0.58%), respectively.

The diagnostic value of multiple sleep latency tests is strongly altered by shift work and to a lesser extent by chronic sleep deprivation. The prevalence of narcolepsy without cataplexy may be 3-fold higher than that of narcolepsy-cataplexy.",2014.0

The median time to diagnosis from first symptoms remains very long, around 10 years in the UK. Conversely, in the specialist setting, it is likely over-diagnosed, largely because of failure to exclude other causes of hypersomnia. There is an over-reliance on a biological marker of the condition, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), which, like many tests, has a significant false-positive and false-negative rate.

129 patients consecutively diagnosed with narcolepsy (73.4% with cataplexy) underwent nocturnal polysomnography followed by a five-nap MSLT.

429 SOREMPs were recorded in 645 MSLT naps (66.5%). The probability of presenting SOREMPs in the fourth nap (3:30 pm) was significantly lower than in the remaining naps: 22.4% SOREMPs in the first nap, 20.5% in the second, 20.5% in the third, 16% in the fourth and 20.5% in the fifth nap (p<0.034). Patients older than 29 years had less SOREMPs than the younger ones (p:0.045). Shortening the MSLT to three or four naps decreased the capability of the test to support the diagnosis of narcolepsy in 14.7 and 10% respectively.

Clinical assessment based on history, neurologic examination, sleep recordings, neurophysiologic neuroimaging, and genetic tests was performed.

History and neurologic examination in both subjects were unremarkable. Genetic analysis disclosed in both the paternally-inherited heterozygous point mutation in the DNMT1 gene. Sleep recordings found sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) revealed increased cerebellar myoinositol (mI) in both subjects. Auditory and ophthalmologic investigations as well as structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed no abnormalities.

The two asymptomatic carriers of the heterozygous DNMT1 mutation for ADCA-DN, a late-onset neurodegenerative disease, presented with SOREMPs associated with an increase of mI in the brain, a marker of glial cell activity and density characteristic of early stages of neurodegenerative diseases.

However, more than half of the patients have onset of symptoms in childhood and/or adolescence. The full spectrum of clinical manifestations, namely excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis, is usually not present at disease onset, delaying diagnosis during childhood. Mean delay in diagnosis since symptom onset is known to be several years. Initial manifestations can sometimes be as subtle as only partial drooping of eyelids leading to confusion with a myasthenic condition.

The diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by multiple sleep latency test along with human leukocyte antigen typing and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin assay.

The diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy at onset can be challenging in young children. With more awareness of subtle signs such as cataplectic facies, earlier diagnosis is possible.

Postvaccine subjects were older at NC onset (12±3 vs. 9±3 years; P=.008) and displayed a shorter mean sleep latency in multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) (2.3±2.2 vs. 3.7±2.9 min; P=.026) compared to pre-H1N1 cases. Anthropometric, clinical (core NC symptoms), hcrt-1 deficiency, and polysomnographic data did not differ among groups, but higher disrupted nocturnal sleep was observed in postvaccine subjects. Comparison of cataplexy features at video assessment showed an overlapping picture with the exception for hyperkinetic movements which appeared to be more evident in pre-H1N1 subjects.

The clinical picture of childhood NC was similar in postvaccine and pre-H1N1 children.",2014.0
24426826,The impact of gender on timeliness of narcolepsy diagnosis.,Won C; Mahmoudi M; Qin L; Purvis T; Mathur A; Mohsenin V,2014 Jan 15,Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,"To examine the impact of gender in narcoleptic patients on timeliness of diagnosis, symptomology, and health and lifestyle impairment.

This is a cross-sectional study of 109 consecutive patients (68 women) with newly diagnosed narcolepsy with and without cataplexy, from a University sleep disorders center. Consecutive patients were administered an 8-page questionnaire at the time of their diagnosis regarding sleep habits, medications, and medical conditions, lifestyle impairments, as well as details regarding narcolepsy-related symptoms.

Men and women presented with remarkably similar narcolepsy related symptoms, yet women were more likely to be delayed in diagnosis; 85% of men were likely to be diagnosed by 16 years after symptom onset, compared to 28 years in women. More women were likely to remain undiagnosed at any given time point after symptom onset (hazard ratio for diagnosis of men compared to women 1.53; 95% CI 1.01-2.32; p = 0.04). Men and women reported similar degree of subjective sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (mean 16.2 ± 4.5; p = 0.18), though women demonstrated significantly more severe objective sleepiness on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) (mean sleep latency in women = 5.4 min (± 4.1), in men 7.4 min (± 3.5); p = 0.03). Despite being more objectively sleepy, women were less likely to report lifestyle impairments in the areas of personal relationships (71% men, 44% women, p = 0.01) and physical activity (36% men, 16% women, p = 0.02), but were also more likely to self-medicate with caffeine (63.4% men, 82.4% women; p = 0.03).

The clinical manifestations of 2 cases were observed, and video-electroencephalogram (VEEG), multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) were performed. Hypocretin 1 level in cerebrospinal fluid was examined in one case.

The onset of disease of case one was started with epilepsy with myoclonic seizure. After half a year, catalepsy induced by emotion especially laughing and excessive daytime sleepiness appeared. MSLT was positive and hypocretin 1 level decreased. Narcolepsy-cataplexy was definitely diagnosed in this case. Valproate was given and seizure was controlled completely, but the excessive daytime sleepiness was aggravated. Combination of valproate, methylphenidate and clomipramine treatment improved the symptoms of narcolepsy and the patient was still free of epileptic seizures. The onset symptoms of case 2 were catalepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. MSLT was positive. The treatment was ineffective because of bad compliance. After 2 years, episodes of impairment of consciousness with automatism occurred. VEEG showed slow waves and spikes in right temporal area. Complex partial seizure was determined. Oxcarbazepine was used and then the patients became seizures free, but the symptoms of narcolepsy were still obvious.

Comorbidity of narcolepsy and epilepsy is a rare phenomenon. Clinical symptoms, predisposing factor, VEEG and MSLT can help diagnosis and differential diagnosis. The antiepileptic drugs might aggravate drowsiness. Based on therapy of epilepsy by using antiepileptic drugs, low dosage of central nervous system stimulants might improve the drowsiness and catalepsy symptoms of narcolepsy.",2013.0
24268496,Narcolepsy-cataplexy and schizophrenia in adolescents.,Huang YS; Guilleminault C; Chen CH; Lai PC; Hwang FM,2014 Jan,Sleep medicine,"Despite advances in the understanding of narcolepsy, little information the on association between narcolepsy and psychosis is available, except for amphetamine-related psychotic reactions. Our case-control study aimed to compare clinical differences and analyze risk factors in children who developed narcolepsy with cataplexy (N-C), schizophrenia, and N-C followed by schizophrenia.

Three age- and gender-matched groups of children with N-C schizophrenia (study group), N-C (control group 1), and schizophrenia only (control group 2) were investigated. Subjects filled out sleep questionnaires, sleep diaries, and quality of life scales, followed by polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT), routine blood tests, HLA typing, genetic analysis of genes of interest, and psychiatric evaluation. The risk factors for schizophrenia also were analyzed.

The study group was significantly overweight when measuring body mass index (BMI) (P=.016), at narcolepsy onset compared to control group 1, and the study group developed schizophrenia after a mean of 2.55±1.8 years. Compared to control group 2, psychotic symptoms were significantly more severe in the study group, with a higher frequency of depressive symptoms and acute ward hospitalization in 8 out of 10 of the subjects. They also had poorer long-term response to treatment, despite multiple treatment trials targeting their florid psychotic symptoms. All subjects with narcolepsy were HLA DQ B1(∗)0602 positive. The study group had a significantly higher frequency of DQ B1(∗)-03:01/06:02 (70%) than the two other groups, without any significant difference in HLA-DR typing, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels, hypocretin (orexin) receptor 1 gene, HCRTR1, and the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene, HCRTR2, or blood infectious titers.

BMI and weight at onset of narcolepsy as well as a higher frequency of DQ B1(∗)-03:01/06:02 antigens were the only significant differences in the N-C children with secondary schizophrenia; such an association is a therapeutic challenge with long-term persistence of severe psychotic symptoms.",2014.0

We aimed to describe clinical and polysomnographic features of a large narcolepsy cohort in order to comprehensively characterize the narcoleptic spectrum.

We performed a chart- and polysomnographybased review of all narcolepsy patients of the Innsbruck narcolepsy cohort.

A total of 100 consecutive narcolepsy patients (87 with cataplexy [NC], 13 without cataplexy [N]) were included in the analysis. All subjects had either excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy as their initial presenting clinical feature. Age at symptom onset was 20 (6-69) years. Diagnostic delay was 6.5 (0-39) years. The complete narcolepsy tetrad was present in 36/100 patients; 28/100 patients had three cardinal symptoms; 29/100 had two; and 7/100 had only excessive daytime sleepiness. Severity varied broadly with respect to excessive daytime sleepiness (median Epworth Sleepiness Scale score: 18, range 10-24), cataplexy (8-point Likert scale: median 4.5, range 1-8), hypnagogic hallucinations (median 4.5, range 1-7), and sleep paralysis (median 3, range 1-7). Sleep comorbidity was highly prevalent and ranged from sleeprelated movement disorders (n = 55/100), parasomnias (n = 34/100), and sleeprelated breathing disorders (n = 24/100), to insomnia (n = 28/100). REM sleep without atonia or a periodic limb movement in sleep index > 5/h were present in most patients (90/100 and 75/100). A high percentage of narcoleptic patients in the present study had high frequency leg movements (35%) and excessive fragmentary myoclonus (22%). Of the narcolepsy patients with clinical features of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), 76.5% had EMG evidence for RBD on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), based on a standard cutoff of a minimum of 18% of 3-sec miniepochs.

This study is one of the largest monocentric polysomnographic studies to date of patients with narcolepsy and confirms the frequent comorbidity of narcolepsy with many other sleep disorders. Our study is the first to evaluate the percentage of patients with high frequency leg movements and excessive fragmentary myoclonus in narcolepsy and is the first to demonstrate EMG evidence of RBD in the MSLT. These findings add to the growing body of literature suggesting that motor instability is a key feature of narcolepsy.",2013.0

However, the test-retest reliability for these central nervous system hypersomnias has never been determined.

Patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and physiologic hypersomnia who underwent two diagnostic multiple sleep latency tests were identified retrospectively. Correlations between the mean sleep latencies on the two studies were evaluated, and we probed for demographic and clinical features associated with reproducibility versus change in diagnosis.

Thirty-six patients (58% women, mean age 34 years) were included. Inter -test interval was 4.2 ± 3.8 years (range 2.5 months to 16.9 years). Mean sleep latencies on the first and second tests were 5.5 (± 3.7 SD) and 7.3 (± 3.9) minutes, respectively, with no significant correlation (r = 0.17, p = 0.31). A change in diagnosis occurred in 53% of patients, and was accounted for by a difference in the mean sleep latency (N = 15, 42%) or the number of sleep onset REM periods (N = 11, 31%). The only feature predictive of a diagnosis change was a history of hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations.

The vaccination coverage in this age cohort was approximately 50%.

Our study was performed to evaluate the possible association between Pandemrix® vaccination and narcolepsy in Norway.

Children and adolescents with sudden onset of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy occurring after the 2009-2010 vaccination period were registered by the National Institute of Public Health in cooperation with the Norwegian Resource Center for AD/HD, Tourette Syndrome, and Narcolepsy.

Fifty-eight vaccinated children and adolescents (35 girls, 23 boys) ages 4-19 years (mean age, 10.5 years) were diagnosed as new cases of confirmed narcolepsy and were included in our study during 2010 and 2011. Forty-two children had onset of symptoms within 6 months after vaccination, with 12 of them having symptoms within the first 6 weeks. All had EDS, 46 had documented cataplexy, 47 had mean sleep latency less than 8 min, and 43 had two or more sleep-onset rapid eye movement sleep (SOREM) periods in multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin levels were measured in 41 patients, with low levels in all. Thirty seven patients that were analyzed had tissue type HLADQB1*0602. During the same period, 10 unvaccinated cases were reported (mean age, 12.5 years).

The data collected during 3 years following vaccination showed a significantly increased risk for narcolepsy with cataplexy (P<.0001) and reduced CSF hypocretin levels in vaccinated children ages 4-19 years the first year after Pandemrix® vaccination, with a minimum incidence of 10 of 100,000 individuals per year. The second year after vaccination, the incidence was 1.1 of 100,000 individuals per year, which was not significantly different from the incidence of 0.5-1 of 100,000 per year in unvaccinated children during the same period.",2013.0

However, previous studies have cast doubt on the specificity and sensitivity of these diagnostic tools.

Eleven variables of the NPSG were analyzed in 101 patients who were retrospectively diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C) (n=24), narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C) (n=38), idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep period (IHL) (n=21), and BIISS (n=18).

Fifteen out of 24 N+C and 8 out of 38 N-C entered the first rapid eye movement (REM) sleep period (FREMP) from sleep stage 1 (N1) or wake (W), though this sleep-stage sequence did not arise in the other patient groups. FREMP stage sequence was a function of REM sleep latency (REML) for both N+C and N-C groups. FREMP stage sequence was not associated with mean sleep latency (MSL) in N+C but was associated in N-C, which implies heterogeneity within the N-C group. REML also was a useful discriminator. Depending on the cutoff period, REML had a sensitivity and specificity of up to 85.5% and 97.4%, respectively.

The FREMP stage sequence may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of narcolepsy, particularly in conjunction with sleep-stage sequence analysis of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in the MSLT; it also may provide a helpful intermediate phenotype in the clarification of heterogeneity in the N-C diagnostic group. However, larger prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",2013.0

The physical examination showed that she was not obese but had kissing tonsils. Polysomnography demonstrated increased apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 5.2, and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) showed shortened mean sleep latency and one sleep-onset REM period (SOREMP). She was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. After the surgery, her sleep became much calmer, but she was still sleepy. Another sleep test showed normal AHI of 0.2, the mean sleep latency of 8 min, and two SOREMPs. Diagnosis of OSA to be effectively treated by surgery and narcolepsy without cataplexy was confirmed. Since young children exhibiting both OSA and narcolepsy can fail to be diagnosed with the latter, it's desirable to conduct MSLT when they have severe daytime sleepiness or fail to get better even with good treatment.",2013.0

In many patients, a short rapid eye movement sleep latency (REML) during the NPSG is also observed but not used diagnostically.

To determine diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of nocturnal REML measures in narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency.

Observational study using receiver operating characteristic curves for NPSG REML and MSLT findings (sleep studies performed between May 1976 and September 2011 at university medical centers in the United States, China, Korea, and Europe) to determine optimal diagnostic cutoffs for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency compared with different samples: controls, patients with other sleep disorders, patients with other hypersomnias, and patients with narcolepsy with normal hypocretin levels. Increasingly stringent comparisons were made. In a first comparison, 516 age- and sex-matched patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency were selected from 1749 patients and compared with 516 controls. In a second comparison, 749 successive patients undergoing sleep evaluation for any sleep disorders (low pretest probability for narcolepsy) were compared within groups by final diagnosis of narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. In the third comparison, 254 patients with a high pretest probability of having narcolepsy were compared within group by their final diagnosis. Finally, 118 patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency were compared with 118 age- and sex-matched patients with a diagnosis of narcolepsy but with normal hypocretin levels.

Sensitivity and specificity of NPSG REML and MSLT as diagnostic tests for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. This diagnosis was defined as narcolepsy associated with cataplexy plus HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity (no cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 results available) or narcolepsy with documented low (≤ 110 pg/mL) cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 level.

Short REML (≤15 minutes) during NPSG was highly specific (99.2% [95% CI, 98.5%-100.0%] of 516 and 99.6% [95% CI, 99.1%-100.0%] of 735) but not sensitive (50.6% [95% CI, 46.3%-54.9%] of 516 and 35.7% [95% CI, 10.6%-60.8%] of 14) for patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency vs population-based controls or all patients with sleep disorders undergoing a nocturnal sleep study (area under the curve, 0.799 [95% CI, 0.771-0.826] and 0.704 [95% CI, 0.524-0.907], respectively). In patients with central hypersomnia and thus a high pretest probability for narcolepsy, short REML remained highly specific (95.4% [95% CI, 90.4%-98.3%] of 132) and similarly sensitive (57.4% [95% CI, 48.1%-66.3%] of 122) for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (area under the curve, 0.765 [95% CI, 0.707-0.831]). Positive predictive value in this high pretest probability sample was 92.1% (95% CI, 83.6%-97.0%).

Among patients being evaluated for possible narcolepsy, short REML (≤15 minutes) at NPSG had high specificity and positive predictive value and may be considered diagnostic without the use of an MSLT; absence of short REML, however, requires a subsequent MSLT.",2013.0

Ninety adult laboratories performing MSLT returned the questionnaire. Indications for MSLT were: narcolepsy, excessive daytime somnolence, driving issues and assessment of wakefulness. Routinely, only 17% of laboratories performed urinary drug screening and 68.2% asked patients to complete sleep diaries. Overnight polysomnography before MSLT was ran in 87.5% of laboratories. There was variation in setup and instructions among countries. Sleep onset was scored as one epoch of any stage sleep by 65.9% of labs.

However, a positive MSLT may be found in other sleep disorders, such as behaviourally induced inadequate sleep syndrome (BIISS). It has been demonstrated that in sleep onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) periods in BIISS, REM sleep tends to arise from stage 2 sleep (non-REM (NREM) 2), rather than stage 1 sleep (NREM1), as in narcolepsy.

We performed sleep stage sequence analysis on 127 patients with nocturnal polysomnography and MSLT, including 25 with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C), 41 with narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C), 21 with idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time (IHL), 20 with BIISS and 20 with periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). 537 naps were recorded, containing 176 SOREM periods.

All SOREM periods in the IHL, BIISS and PLMD groups arose from NREM2 sleep, 75% of those in N+C arose from NREM1 and in N-C only 52% arose from NREM1. Within the N-C group, those with SOREM periods all arising from stage 1 had a shorter MSL (p=0.02).

These results suggest that SOREM periods arising from NREM1 have high sensitivity for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and that SOREM periods from NREM1 are a marker of severity, either of sleepiness or REM instability. Sleep stage sequence analysis of SOREM periods may also aid more accurate phenotyping of the hypersomnias and in particular clarify heterogeneity among patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy.",2013.0

Narcolepsy without cataplexy (n = 171) and control patients (n = 170), all with available CSF hypocretin-1.

Retrospective comparison and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Patients were also recontacted to evaluate if they developed cataplexy by survival curve analysis.

The optimal cutoff of CSF hypocretin-1 for narcolepsy without cataplexy diagnosis was 200 pg/ml rather than 110 pg/ml (sensitivity 33%, specificity 99%). Forty-one patients (24%), all HLA DQB1*06:02 positive, had low concentrations (≤ 110 pg/ml) of CSF hypocretin-1. Patients with low concentrations of hypocretin-1 only differed subjectively from other groups by a higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score and more frequent sleep paralysis. Compared with patients with normal hypocretin-1 concentration (n = 117, 68%), those with low hypocretin-1 concentration had higher HLA DQB1*06:02 frequencies, were more frequently non-Caucasians (notably African Americans), with lower age of onset, and longer duration of illness. They also had more frequently short rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep latency (≤ 15 min) during polysomnography (64% versus 23%), and shorter sleep latencies (2.7 ± 0.3 versus 4.4 ± 0.2 min) and more sleep-onset REM periods (3.6 ± 0.1 versus 2.9 ± 0.1 min) during the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Patients with intermediate concentrations of CSF hypocretin-1 (n = 13, 8%) had intermediate HLA DQB1*06:02 and polysomnography results, suggesting heterogeneity. Of the 127 patients we were able to recontact, survival analysis showed that almost half (48%) with low concentration of CSF hypocretin-1 had developed typical cataplexy at 26 yr after onset, whereas only 2% had done so when CSF hypocretin-1 concentration was normal. Almost all patients (87%) still complained of daytime sleepiness independent of hypocretin status.

Hypocretin system is one of the key players in the complex interaction between sleep and the cardiovascular system. We tested the hypothesis that hypocretin deficiency affects cardiovascular risk factors by measuring nighttime and daytime ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and the night-to-day BP ratio as well as endothelial dysfunction by the digital pulse amplitude response in drug-free patients with NC compared to controls.

Sleep, clinical and biological cardiovascular risk factors, fingertip peripheral arterial tonometry, and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring were recorded in 50 drug-free patients with NC and 42 healthy control subjects, except for BP monitoring available in all controls but in 36 patients with NC.

More patients than controls were smokers, obese and with dyslipidemia. One-third of patients with NC were ""non-dippers"" (defined as <10% drop in BP during sleep) compared to only 3% of controls. The diastolic non-dipper BP profile had up to 12-fold higher odds of being associated with NC. We noted negative correlations between mean diastolic BP fall during night, REM sleep percentage and number of sleep onset REM periods, and a positive correlation with mean sleep latency on the MSLT. The digital pulse amplitude response measured by fingertip was similar between NC and controls.

We found a high percentage of non-dippers in patients with NC with association with REM sleep dysregulation. The blunted sleep-related BP dip in NC may be of clinical relevance, as it may indicate increased risk for cardiovascular events.",2012.0

Indeed, the features and diagnostic utility of spontaneous daytime sleep at 24 h continuous polysomnography (PSG) have never been investigated.

Daytime sleep time was significantly higher in narcolepsy-cataplexy but similar in the other groups. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves showed that the number of naps during daytime PSG predicted a mean sleep latency ≤8 min at MSLT with an area under the curve of 0.67 ± 0.05 (P = 0.005). The number of daytime sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in spontaneous naps strikingly predicted the scheduled occurrence of two or more SOREMPs at MSLT, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.93 ± 0.03 (P < 10(-12) ).

22558075,Executive control of attention in narcolepsy.,Bayard S; Croisier Langenier M; Cochen De Cock V; Scholz S; Dauvilliers Y,2012,PloS one,"Narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) is a disabling sleep disorder characterized by early loss of hypocretin neurons that project to areas involved in the attention network. We characterized the executive control of attention in drug-free patients with NC to determine whether the executive deficits observed in patients with NC are specific to the disease itself or whether they reflect performance changes due to the severity of excessive daytime sleepiness.

Twenty-two patients with NC compared to 22 patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy (NwC) matched for age, gender, intellectual level, objective daytime sleepiness and number of sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) were studied. Thirty-two matched healthy controls were included. All participants underwent a standardized interview, completed questionnaires, and neuropsychological tests. All patients underwent a polysomnography followed by multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT), with neuropsychological evaluation performed the same day between MSLT sessions.

Irrespective of diagnosis, patients reported higher self-reported attentional complaints associated with the intensity of depressive symptoms. Patients with NC performed slower and more variably on simple reaction time tasks than patients with NwC, who did not differ from controls. Patients with NC and NwC generally performed slower, reacted more variably, and made more errors than controls on executive functioning tests. Individual profile analyses showed a clear heterogeneity of the severity of executive deficit. This severity was related to objective sleepiness, higher number of SOREMPs on the MSLT, and lower intelligence quotient. The nature and severity of the executive deficits were unrelated to NC and NwC diagnosis.

We demonstrated that drug-free patients with NC and NwC complained of attention deficit, with altered executive control of attention being explained by the severity of objective sleepiness and global intellectual level. Further studies are needed to explore whether medications that promote wakefulness can improve the executive functions in narcolepsy.",2012.0

There is, however, only one reported case in literature from India. In this study, we report characteristics of patients with narcolepsy over a seven-year period.

Details of all patients with narcolepsy seen at a Sleep Disorders Clinic over seven years were analyzed. Diagnosis had been established by clinical history and two or more Sleep Onset Rapid Eye Movement Periods (SOREMPs) on Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) following an overnight Polysomnography (PSG), using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders - 2 (ICSD-2) criteria. Patients fulfilling the criteria, but suffering from other disorders were excluded.

Data of 20 patients were analyzed and 4 patients were excluded, as they had other associated conditions. Mean age at onset of symptoms was 25±10 years; 12 (60%) patients had narcolepsy with cataplexy, 4 (20%) patients presented with all cardinal symptoms of narcolepsy, 8 (40%) with 3 symptoms, while 8 (40%) presented with 2 symptoms. History of Excessive Day-Time Sleepiness (EDS) was present in all patients. Three patients reported accidents due to sleep attacks, one being life-threatening. On PSG, mean sleep efficiency was 79.4±12.40%. Mean sleep latency during MSLT was 1.30 minute (range: 0.30-2.30 minute) and mean REM latency was 2.58±0.64 minute.

In contrast, CPT1B/CHKB polymorphisms have only been shown to be associated with narcolepsy in Japanese, with replication in a small group of Koreans. Our aim was to study whether these polymorphisms are associated with narcolepsy and its clinical characteristics in Chinese patients with narcolepsy.

We collected clinical data on 510 Chinese patients presenting with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. Patients were included either when hypocretin deficiency was documented (CSF hypocretin-1≤110 pg/ml, n=91) or on the basis of the presence of clear cataplexy and HLA-DQB1∗0602 positivity (n=419). Genetic data was compared to typing obtained in 452 controls matched for geographic origin within China. Clinical evaluations included demographics, the Stanford Sleep Inventory (presence and age of onset of each symptom), and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) data.

Chinese narcolepsy was strongly and dose dependently associated with TCRA (rs1154155C) and P2RY11 (rs2305795A) but not CPT1B/CHKB (rs5770917C) polymorphisms. CPT1B/CHKB polymorphisms were not associated with any specific clinical characteristics. TCRA rs1154155A homozygotes (58 subjects) had a later disease onset, but this was not significant when corrected for multiple comparisons, thus replication is needed. CPT1B/CHKB or P2RY11 polymorphisms were not associated with any specific clinical characteristics.

This study meta-analyses and reviews the effectiveness of GHB on the clinical features of narcolepsy and its neurophysiological correlates.

A systematic review of the literature using Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane reviews, clinical-trials.gov, Scopus, Scirus, and a subsequent meta-analysis were performed. Considered outcomes were: cataplexy attacks, subjective daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks, clinical global impression change (CGI-c), quality of life (QoL), hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, mean sleep latencies on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), nocturnal polysomnographic data.

Nine randomized controlled trials reporting data on the effectiveness of GHB on narcolepsy were identified, for a total of 1,154 patients (771 patients in the GHB-treated group and 383 in the placebo group). The meta-analysis showed that GHB reduced cataplexy attacks both on a daily (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.29/-0.90, p < 0.00001) and a weekly basis (WMD -7.04; 95% CI -12.45/-1.63, p = 0.01), subjective nocturnal awakenings (WMD -1.33; 95% CI -1.78/-0.88, p < 0.00001), daytime sleep attacks on a weekly basis (WMD -9.30; 95% CI -15.92/-2.68, p = 0.006), subjective daytime sleepiness (WMD -2.81; 95% CI -4.13/-1.49, p < 0.0001) and sleep stage shifts (WMD -9.69; 95% CI -17.14/-2.24, p = 0.01). GHB increased sleep stages 3 + 4 (WMD 4.11; 95% CI 0.07/8.16, p = 0.05) and improved the CGI-c score (odds ratio (OR) 3.45; 95% CI 2.47/4.80, p < 0.00001).

Objective testing is more important in ambiguous disease. The gold-standard objective test in these cases is the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Repeat testing can be burdensome but is reasonable when faced with a diagnostic dilemma. However, there is limited evidence to support this approach. In this study, we assessed the diagnostic utility of a repeat MSLT in patients suspected of narcolepsy whose first MSLT result was nonconfirmatory.

Of 125 patients who underwent an MSLT between 2004 and 2009, we identified 10 (9.6%) who had undergone repeat studies. We analyzed changes in MSLT parameters while taking account of other relevant differences between testing.

Two patients (20%) met narcolepsy criteria during the second MSLT. Nine patients (90%) met sleepiness criteria (mean sleep latency <8 minutes) during the second MSLT while only 5 did during the first (P = 0.05).

We demonstrate that a repeat MSLT confirmed the diagnosis of narcolepsy in 20% of patients whose results had been nonconfirmatory on a first MSLT. This study provides support for a repeat MSLT in cases where clinical suspicion for narcolepsy is high despite an ambiguous first test.",2011.0

The NA with CA group had significantly more disrupted and shallower nocturnal sleep than the other groups. On MSLT, the IHS w/o LST group had significantly longer sleep latency (SL) compared with the two NA groups. The latter two groups did not show statistical differences in diurnal variation of SL.

The IHS w/o LST group had milder objective daytime sleepiness compared with the NA groups. In patients with NA, nocturnal sleep disturbances appeared only in cases with CA, despite a similar trend in diurnal changes in sleep propensity between the two NA groups.

Objective nocturnal sleep disturbances are specific to NA patients with CA, whereas diurnal variations of sleep propensity are observed irrespective of the presence of CA among NA patients.

A total of 417 children (< 18 years old) successively presenting with complaints of hypersomnia without anatomic cause or sleep apnea risk were evaluated using the Stanford Sleep Inventory, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1*0602 typing, and MSLT recordings. CSF hypocretin-1 was measured in 47 cases to document hypocretin deficiency. A subgroup (""narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency"") with likely hypocretin deficiency (low hypocretin-1 or HLA positive with clear-cut cataplexy) was further examined for presentations prior to, around, or after puberty.

Narcolepsy with (n = 361) or without (n = 17) cataplexy presented at an earlier age and with increased male predominance when compared to idiopathic hypersomnia (n = 39, P < 0.01). Nearly 70% of those with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (n = 271) had disease onset before age 10 y, and 15% had onset before age 6, an unusually young age distribution. Onset was prior to puberty in 78% of cases. Clinical features were similar in presentations across puberty groups except for sleep paralysis, which increased in frequency with age/puberty. Mean sleep latency (MSL) decreased and the number of sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) increased with age/puberty, but MSLT diagnosis criteria (MSL ≤ 8 min, ≥ 2 SOREMPs) were similarly positive across groups.

In children, narcolepsy without cataplexy is more frequently seen than in adults. The aim of our study was to evaluate clinical and polysomnographic parameters to verify if cataplexy appearing later in life can be foretold.

30 patients (12 boys), who contracted narcolepsy before the age of 18, were enrolled. All underwent clinical examination, nocturnal polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), HLA-DQB1∗0602 testing and, most of them Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) rating. The Mann-Whitney rank and Fisher's tests were used for statistical analysis.

Narcolepsy without cataplexy (NwC) was diagnosed in 40% of the patients. The mean age at the first symptoms was 14.0 ± 3.0, at diagnosis 15.6 ± 3.1 years. Narcolepsy was accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations in 15 and sleep paralysis in 12 patients. Frequent symptoms were sleep inertia during awakening, REM behavior symptoms, behavioral and serious school problems. BMI was higher in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy (N-C). A high ESS score was indicative of excessive daytime sleepiness (17.1 ± 2.5). Mean MSLT sleep latency was 4.0 ± 3.1 min with 3.2 ± 1.4 sleep onset REM periods (SOREMs) with no difference between the two study groups. HLA typing revealed no differences either.

We used the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to assess decision making under ambiguity condition based on emotional feedback processing and the Game of Dice Task (GDT) to assess decision making under risk condition. All participants underwent a semi-structured psychiatric interview and completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale. Patients underwent one night of polysomnography followed by an MSLT, with neuropsychological evaluation performed between MSLT sessions.

NC patients had higher depressive symptoms and showed a significant lack of perseverance. One NC patient had a past history of drug dependence. NC patients also exhibited selective reduced IGT performance and normal performance on the GDT. No clinical or polysomnographic characteristics were associated with increased sensitivity to reward and/or decreased sensitivity to punishment. However, lack of perseverance in NC patients was associated with disadvantageous decision making on the IGT.

We demonstrated a lack of perseverance and a selective reduced performance on decision making under ambiguity in NC in contrast to normal decision making under explicit conditions.

Prospective data on medication response was collected in 78% using a specially designed questionnaire.

patients were separated into children with onset of narcolepsy prior to (53%), around (29%), and after (18%) puberty. None of the children had secondary narcolepsy. Clinical features were similar across puberty groups, except for sleep paralysis, which increased in frequency with age. Common features included excessive weight gain (84% ≥ 4 kg within 6 months of onset of narcolepsy) and earlier puberty (when compared with family members), notably in subjects who gained the most weight. Streptococcus-positive throat infections were reported in 20% of cases within 6 months of onset of narcolepsy. Polysomnographic features were similar across groups, but 3 prepubertal children did not meet Multiple Sleep Latency Test diagnostic criteria. Regarding treatment, the most used and continued medications were modafinil (84% continued), sodium oxybate (79%), and venlafaxine (68%). Drugs such as methylphenidate, tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were often tried but rarely continued. Modafinil was reported to be effective for treating sleepiness, venlafaxine for cataplexy, and sodium oxybate for all symptoms, across all puberty groups.

Selective REM sleep deprivation was successful in both controls (mean reduction of REM to 6% of baseline) and narcoleptics (11%). Both groups had a reduction of total sleep time during the deprivation nights (P = 0.03). Neither group had REM sleep rebound in the recovery night. Narcoleptics had, however, an increase in the number of SOREMs on MSLT (P = 0.005). There was no increase in the number of cataplexies after selective REM sleep deprivation. We conclude that: (i) REM sleep pressure is higher in narcoleptics; (ii) REM sleep homeostasis is similar in narcoleptics and controls; (iii) in narcoleptics selective REM sleep deprivation may have an effect on sleep propensity but not on cataplexy.",2011.0
20810311,Modafinil reverses hypoexcitability of the motor cortex in narcoleptic patients: a TMS study.,Nardone R; Bergmann J; Lochner P; Caleri F; Kunz A; Staffen W; Tezzon F; Ladurner G; Trinka E; Golaszewski S,2010 Oct,Sleep medicine,"Although many animal and human studies have been performed, the exact mechanisms of action whereby modafinil promotes wakefulness are still not completely understood. We aimed to investigate the functional effects of modafinil on motor cortex excitability in patients with narcolepsy by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques.

In a double-blind and placebo-controlled design, 24 drug-naive narcoleptic patients with cataplexy and 20 control subjects were administered modafinil or placebo over a period of 4 weeks. TMS was performed twice during the awake state before and at the end of treatment; measures of cortical excitability included central motor conduction time, resting motor threshold, short latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation to paired-TMS. TMS measures were correlated with the conventional neurophysiological method of Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).

As previously reported, motor threshold and SICI were significantly increased in patients with narcolepsy; modafinil reversed this cortical hypoexcitability, but only SICI differences reached statistical significance. The Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed the highest correlation between SICI and the MSLT; a positive correlation was also found between SICI and the ESS, as well as between RMT and both measures of daytime sleepiness.

This represents the first report investigating effects of modafinil on cortical excitability in human narcolepsy. Since SICI is thought to be directly related to GABA(A) intracortical inhibitory activity, we demonstrated that the dose of modafinil that induces a satisfactory wakefulness-promoting response in narcoleptic patients also causes decrease in GABAergic transmission.",2010.0

The purpose of this study was to compare the objective Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) for evaluating the efficacy of modafinil in treating excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy in Taiwan. Ten consecutive patients with narcolepsy-with-cataplexy who were treated with 200 mg/day modafinil for more than 6 months at our sleep center between January 2003 and December 2007 were included in this study. This comparative study was prompted by the requirement of the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan that modafinil users need to be followed up with MSLTs every 6-12 months. The mean age at onset of narcolepsy onset in these 10 patients was 11.8 +/- 3.3 years, and eight (80%) were male. We compared the differences in MSLT and ESS between baseline and follow-up at 6-12 months after starting modafinil therapy using paired t tests. ESS scores (p < 0.001) were considerably more sensitive than MSLT scores (p < 0.05) in documenting efficacy of modafinil and that the improvements in MSLT scores were minimal and remained in the pathologically sleepy range. These findings suggest that the ESS is a more sensitive and clinically meaningful tool to evaluate the efficacy of modafinil in narcolepsy.",2010.0

We included 9 trials involving 1,054 patients in the study. Modafinil in comparison with placebo brings significant benefit in terms of elimination of excessive daytime sleepiness assessed by: ESS scale--weighted mean difference (WMD) -2.73 points (95%CI -3.39, -2.08), MSLT test--WMD 1.11 minutes (95%CI 0.55, 1.66) and MWT test--WMD 2.82 minutes (95%CI 2.40, 3.24), as well as the number and duration of somnolence, sleep attacks and naps per day, but was not different from placebo in the number of attacks of cataplexy per day. Modafinil in comparison with placebo improved quality of life of narcoleptic patients according to SF-36 questionnaire, but was associated with more common nausea. It had similar effect on excessive daytime sleepiness as sodium oxybate and was associated with less common nausea.

In narcoleptic patients, modafinil in comparison with placebo is effective in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness, but not cataplexy.",2010.0

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between these characteristic symptoms of narcolepsy and CSF-orexin level. Fifty-three patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (NA/CA) and 17 without cataplexy (NA w/o CA) were enrolled. Sleep latency and sleep onset REM latency were measured using the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with both mean sleep latency and mean sleep onset REM latency on MSLT, with %body mass index (BMI), gender, onset age, length of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) morbidity, diagnostic subgroup and CSF-orexin levels being used as independent variables. The NA/CA group included a significantly higher number of patients with undetectable CSF-orexin levels and shorter sleep onset and rapid eye movement (SOREM) latency, as well as a higher %BMI, versus NA w/o CA. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that sleep latency was associated significantly with CSF-orexin levels and gender. With regard to sleep onset REM latency and %BMI, only CSF-orexin levels appeared to be a significantly associated factor. In narcoleptic patients, the severity of both excessive daytime sleepiness and increased REM propensity, as well as the level of obesity, could be associated with CSF-orexin deficiency, rather than with subcategories of the disorder.",2011.0

We analysed sleep onset characteristics at the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) applying simultaneously two sleep onset criteria in 44 NC, seven NwoC and 16 IH consecutive patients referred for subjective EDS complaint. Sleep latency (SL) at MSLT was assessed both as the time elapsed to the occurrence of a single epoch of sleep Stage 1 NREM (SL) and of unequivocal sleep [three sleep Stage 1 NREM epochs or any other sleep stage epoch, sustained SL (SusSL)]. Idiopathic hypersomnia patients showed significantly (P<0.0001) longer SusSL than SL (7.7±2.5 versus 5.6±1.3 min, respectively) compared to NwoC (5.8±2.5 versus 5.3±2.2 min) and NC patients (4.1±3 versus 3.9±3 min). A mean difference threshold between SusSL and SL ≥27 s reached a diagnostic value to discriminate IH versus NC and NwoC sufferers (sensitivity 88%; specificity 82%). Moreover, NC patients showed better subjective sleepiness perception than NwoC and IH cases in the comparison between naps with or without sleep occurrence. Simultaneous application of the two widely used sleep onset criteria differentiates IH further from NC and NwoC patients: IH fluctuate through a wake-Stage 1 NREM sleep state before the onset of sustained sleep, while NC and NwoC shift abruptly into a sustained sleep. The combination of SusSL and SL determination at MSLT should be tested as an additional objective differential criterion for EDS disorders.",2011.0

Twenty three untreated patients were studied and compared with a matched control group. Diagnosis of narcolepsy was carried out employing a clinical interview, a polysomnographic (PSG) record, and an MSLT.

Subjective number of awakenings was the SSQ indicator that best correlated with EDS (ESS and MSLT). Regarding clinical features, diurnal tiredness and sleep paralysis correlated with ESS values. Increase in ESS was related with decrease in total sleep time, SWS, and sleep onset latency. On the other hand, increase in MSLT was related with decrease in SWS.

These data suggest that EDS in patients with narcolepsy could be impaired by disturbed nocturnal sleep.",2009.0

Main symptoms of narcolepsy include excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Establishing the proper diagnosis is very important, because of the negative impact of narcolepsy on patients' functioning in social-life and the possibility of improvement of quality of life with adequate treatment.

Present review describes clinical characteristics of narcolepsy, usefulness of neurophysiological tests in differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and assessing the efficacy of the treatment, as well as the application of novel biological methods in diagnosis of narcolepsy.

According to diagnostic criteria of ICSD-2 the diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on the clinical features and diagnostic examinations and tests. Among them neurophysiological procedures, such as polysomnography (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are still recommended as most useful in differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias. In recent decades novel biochemical and genetic tools have been developed as diagnostic measures in narcolepsy, including the levels of hypocretin in cerebral spinal fluid and HLA DQB1*0602 typing. These both biological markers are strongly associated with the occurrence of cataplexy, therefore do not present considerable diagnostic value in narcolepsy without cataplexy.

Neurophysiological procedures (MSLT) and biological markers are necessary in the diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy and hypersomnia without cataplexy. Neurophysiological procedures are useful in monitoring of the treatment of hypersomnia also.",2010.0

The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by MSLT, video-polysomnography and HLA typing. Polysomnographic recordings were scored with particular regard to REM sleep without atonia (RWA) across all the nocturnal REM periods. RWA scoring was done according to a standard method.

The analysis showed a significant increase in the proportion of REM sleep without atonia during successive nocturnal REM periods in narcoleptic patients (p<0.01). No correlation was found between the percentage of RWA and the severity or duration of the disease, no age effect was documented.

19464232,Multiple sleep latency measures in narcolepsy and behaviourally induced insufficient sleep syndrome.,Marti I; Valko PO; Khatami R; Bassetti CL; Baumann CR,2009 Dec,Sleep medicine,"Short mean latencies to the first epoch of non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 1 (NREM1) and the presence of >or= 2 sleep onset REM (SOREM) periods on multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) occur in both narcolepsy-cataplexy (NC) and behaviourally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (BIISS). It is not known whether specific MSLT findings help differentiate the two disorders.

We analyzed MSLT data including sleep latencies to and between different sleep stages of 60 age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-matched subjects (hypocretin-deficient NC, actigraphy-confirmed BIISS, healthy controls: each 20).

Mean latency (in minutes) to NREM1 sleep was significantly shorter in NC (1.8+/-1.5) than in BIISS (4.7+/-2.1, p<0.001) and controls (11.4+/-3.3, p<0.001). Mean latency to NREM2 sleep was similar in NC (8.6+/-4.7) and BIISS (8.1+/-2.7, p=0.64); latency to either NREM2 or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (i.e., the sum of the sleep latency to NREM1 and the duration of the first NREM1 sleep sequence), however, was shorter in NC (4.4+/-2.9) than in BIISS (7.9+/-3.5, p<0.001). Referring to all naps with SOREM periods, the sequence NREM1-REM-NREM2 was more common (71%) in NC than in BIISS (15%, p<0.001), reflecting the shorter latency from NREM1 to NREM2 in BIISS (3.7+/-2.5) than in NC (6.1+/-5.9, p<0.001).

Our findings show that both sleepiness (as measured by NREM1 sleep latency) and REM sleep propensity are higher in NC than in BIISS. Furthermore, our finding of frequent REM sleep prior to NREM2 sleep in NC is in line with the recent assumption of an insufficient NREM sleep intensity in NC. Together with detailed clinical interviews, sleep logs, actigraphy, and nocturnal polysomnography, mean sleep latencies to NREM1 <or= 2.5 min, the presence of multiple SOREM periods, and the sequence NREM1-REM-NREM2 may be the best MSLT measures to discriminate NC from BIISS.",2009.0

The severity of the disease was judged by clinical complaints, ESS value and MSLT results. No relations with the age at onset and clinical tetrad were found, however, smoking may be associated with an increased risk of hypnagogic hallucinations. There was no correlation between the number of sleep and cataplectic attacks and the age at onset, nor did subjective ESS show any significant dependence. However, earlier onset of the disease correlated with shorter MSLT mean latency. A correlation was found between the BMI and narcolepsy sleepiness rating in the elderly and between degree of education attained and subjective complaints.

Among the three narcoleptic groups, the NA w/o CA HLA-negative group showed the lowest REM latency and the highest reduction rate of ESS after treatment. Neither these subjective and objective sleepiness measures nor the treatment response measure was significantly different between this group and the IHS w/o LST group.

Patients affected with a different diagnosis and with and without depressive symptoms were compared.

Mean ESS and body mass index were higher in C+ compared with C-/IH patients. Half of the patients (44.9%) had no depressive symptoms while 26.3% had mild, 23.2% moderate and 5.6% severe depressive symptoms. C+ patients had higher S-BDI and PSQI and lower SF-36 scores than C-/IH patients. Depressed patients had higher ESS scores than non-depressed patients, with no difference in age, gender, duration of disease or MSLT parameters. Finally, C+ patients treated with anticataplectic drugs (38.7%) had higher S-BDI and lower SF-36 scores than C+ patients treated with stimulants alone.

Our data confirmed the high frequency of depressive symptoms and the major impact of central hypersomnias on health related quality of life, especially in patients with cataplexy.

One hundred and sixty-nine patients with narcolepsy and 116 normal controls matched for age and gender were included. Narcoleptics with high and low PLMS indices were compared to assess the impact of PLMS on sleep and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) variables. More narcoleptics than controls had a PLMS index greater than 5 per hour of sleep (67% versus 37%) and an index greater than 10 (53% versus 21%). PLMS indices were higher both in NREM and REM sleep in narcoleptic patients, but the between-group difference was greater for REM sleep. A significant increase of PLMS index was also found with aging in both narcoleptic patients and controls. PLMW indices were also significantly higher in narcoleptic patients. Patients with an elevated index of PLMS had a higher percentage of stage 1 sleep, a lower percentage of REM sleep, a lower REM efficiency and a shorter MSLT latency. The present study demonstrates a high frequency of PLMS and PLMW in narcolepsy, an association between the presence of PLMS and measures of REM sleep and daytime functioning disruption. These results suggest that PLMS represent an intrinsic feature of narcolepsy.",2007.0

Three academic medical centers with level I trauma centers, accredited sleep disorders centers, and rehabilitative medicine programs. Participants; Eighty-seven (87) adults at least 3 months post TBI.

Abnormal sleep studies were found in 40 subjects (46%), including 20 (23%) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 10 (11%) with posttraumatic hypersomnia (PTH), 5 (6%) with narcolepsy, and 6 (7%) with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). Among all subjects, 22 (25%) were found to have objective excessive daytime sleepiness with MSLT score <10 minutes. There was no correlation between ESS score and MSLT (r = 0.10). There were no differences in age, race, sex, or education between the sleepy and non-sleepy subjects. Likewise, there were no differences in severity of injury or time after injury between sleepy and non-sleepy subjects. Sleepy subjects had a greater body mass index (BMI) than those who were not sleepy (p = 0.01). OSA was more common in obese subjects (BMI > or =30, p < 0.001). Sleepy subjects demonstrated poorer PVT scores (p < 0.05), better self-reported sleep related quality of life (FOSQ scores [p < 0.05]), and no differences in POMS.

There is a high prevalence of sleep disorders (46%) and of excessive daytime sleepiness (25%) in subjects with TBI. Sleepy subjects may be more impaired than comparable non-sleepy TBI subjects, yet be unaware of problems. Given the high prevalence of OSA (23%), PTH (11%), and narcolepsy (7%) in this population, there is a clinical indication for NPSG and MSLT.",2007.0

Case control design

Twelve narcoleptic probands, 34 first-degree relatives, and 30 healthy controls.

N/A.

Each subject underwent a standardized nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG), followed by a daytime multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). HLA typing was performed for all subjects. One relative (2.9%) was diagnosed as suffering from narcolepsy with cataplexy. Nearly 30% of the relatives fulfilled the criteria of narcolepsy spectrum disorder (shortened mean sleep latency [MSL] and/or the presence of sleep onset REM periods [SOREMPs]). When using the population data for comparison, the relative risk of narcolepsy in first-degree relatives was 85.3. The odds ratio of narcolepsy spectrum disorder in first-degree relatives was 5.8 (95% CI: 1.2 - 29.3) when compared to healthy controls. There existed 6 multiplex families, in which all 10 relatives with narcolepsy spectrum disorders, including all 3 relatives with multiple SOREMPs, were positive for HLA DQB1*0602.

Our study demonstrated a definitive familial aggregation of narcolepsy, narcolepsy spectrum disorders, and possibly cataplexy in Hong Kong Chinese. This familial aggregation supported an inherited basis for narcolepsy spectrum. The tight co-segregation of HLA DQB1*0602 and narcolepsy spectrum disorders might suggest that HLA typing, especially DQB1*0602, at least partly confer the familial risk of narcolepsy. In addition, our study suggested that the subjective questionnaire measurements including Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were unable to detect the presence of narcolepsy spectrum disorders among the relatives. A stringent objective measurement-based design for family studies is suggested for future study. Further studies are indicated for the determination of the mode and molecular level of narcolepsy transmission.",2007.0

Little is known about the possible difference in pathophysiology between patients with or without cataplexy.

Our study was prospective and controlled (transversal) with 22 narcoleptic patients and 23 health control subjects. Patients underwent an all-night polysomnographic recording (PSG) and a multiple sleep latency Test (MSLT). The histocompatibility antigen allele (HLA-DQB1*0602), T CD4, CD8 and B lymphocytes were quantified in control subjects and in narcoleptics.

The HLA-DQB1*0602 allele was identified in 10 (62.5%) of our 16 cataplexic subjects and in 2 (33.3%) of the 6 patients without cataplexy (p=0.24). In control subjects, HLA-DQB1*0602 allele was identified in 5 (20%). A significant decrease in T CD4 and B lymphocytes was found in narcoleptic patients with recurrent cataplexy when compared with our patients without cataplexy.

Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis were associated with a decrease in sub-group of T CD4 and B lymphocytes. A drop in B lymphocytes count in reumathoid arthritis might, it is posited, be correlated to the presence of HLA-DRB1 allele along with an overall worsened outcome of the affliction. The theory of an increase in consumption of B lymphocytes over the maturation phase has likewise been put forward. Our study reinforces the view that narcolepsy should be considered from an immunological perspective.",2007.0

38 drug-naive narcoleptic patients, 25 males and 13 females, aged 21 +/- 6.5, and 44 age-, sex ratio-, and BMI-matched normal persons underwent polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) during one night sleep. Conventional visual scoring of the polysomnograms was performed according to the international.

The sleep latency of the patients was 5.6 min, however, 30 patients (79%) complained of fragmented nocturnal sleep and difficulty to fall asleep again. The sleep efficiency of the narcoleptics was 81.7% +/- 12.5%, significantly lower than that of the normal persons (87.1% +/- 7.9%, P = 0.029). The non-rapid eye movement (NREM) I sleep accounted for (21.5 +/- 12.2)% in the patients, a proportion significantly higher than that of the normal persons [(10.3 +/- 6.3)%, P = 0.000]). The AHI of the patients was 0.6 +/- 1.3 times/h, not significantly different from that of the normal persons (0.5 +/- 1.1 times/h). Although the rapid eye movement (REM) period and eye movement density of the narcoleptics were significantly increased, their REM period duration was not significantly different from that of the normal subjects (17.7% +/- 6.9% vs 18.9% +/- 5.5%, P = 0.23), probably due to the interruption of REM sleep by more frequent arousals in narcoleptics.

Patients diagnosed with narcolepsy between January 1999 and December 2005 were divided into those with PLM index >or= 5/hr and <5/hr. Each patient underwent polysomnographic recording followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).

There were 47 patients, of mean age 28.9 +/- 1.8 years, 31 (66%) with PLM index >or= 5/hr and 16 (34%) with PLM index <5/hr. Arousal index, PLM arousals and total number of arousals were all significantly higher in narcoleptics with PLM index >or= 5/hr than in those with PLM index <5/hr. Significant correlations were found between PLM index and arousal index, stage shifts, Stage 1 and average sleep latency on MSLT.

Our findings demonstrated that narcolepsy patients with PLMs have a higher arousal index and increased PLM arousals compared with narcolepsy patients without PLMs. The contribution of the above to the perceived sleep quality and daytime sleepiness is not clear.",2007.0

We performed in all patients a clinical interview, a nocturnal polysomnogram and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), HLA analysis and measurement of CSF Hcrt-1 levels (low < or = 110 pg/mL).

Out of 51 patients, 31 were classified as NC, 11 as NnC and 8 as IH. 34 patients (66.7%) had low CSF Hcrt-1 levels (29 NC, 3 NnC and 1 IH). In the NC group, 96.1% were HLA DQB1*0602 positive and 91% had low CSF Hcrt-1 levels. The most frequent variables found in NC patients and in those with a low CSF Hcrt-1 levels were cataplexy, fragmented nocturnal sleep, short refreshing naps, automatic behavior, HLA DQB1*0602, and, in the MSLT, a short mean sleep latency, a higher number of REM sleep episodes and a short mean latency of REM sleep episodes. A long nocturnal sleep time and morning sleep drunkenness, 2 variables used in the ICSD-2 for the diagnosis of IH, were not different among the three groups of hypersomnias.

17239659,Quantifying microsleep to help assess subjective sleepiness.,Blaivas AJ; Patel R; Hom D; Antigua K; Ashtyani H,2007 Mar,Sleep medicine,"The qualitative presence of microsleep during the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) has been shown to correlate with an increased incidence of subjective complaints of sleepiness, tiredness, accidents/near accidents, and gap driving. However, there is no data on how to quantify microsleep and effectively incorporate it as a diagnostic tool in the measurement of sleepiness. The purpose of this study was to integrate microsleep with the MSLT score and determine if it improved the correlation between the MSLT and symptomatic sleepiness.

The charts of 54 patients who had an MSLT score of greater than 5min and the presence of microsleep on at least one nap were reviewed. If microsleep was present in a given nap it was used as a surrogate for sleep onset. This MSLT plus microsleep score (MSL-M) was then averaged into the total sleep latency and compared to the MSLT score to determine if it improves correlation with the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). A microsleep nap percentage (MNP) was also obtained and correlated with ESS to determine if a better association could be derived.

Using the Spearman correlation the MSL-M improved the correlation with the ESS when compared to MSLT (r=0.106 versus r=0.063), but the results were not statistically significant. Of note, both the MSLT and MSL-M were only weakly correlated to the ESS. The MNP also did not have a good correlation with ESS (r=-0.099).

The addition of microsleep onset to the MSLT score as a quantitative assessment tool failed to significantly enhance the correlation between subjective and objective accounts of sleepiness, beyond the improvement seen in the MSLT value by the simple presence of microsleep alone.",2007.0

Patients were submitted to the MSLT between January/1999 and June/2002. Sleep onset latency, REM sleep latency and total sleep time were determined. The occurrence of dreams was inquired following each MSLT series. Patients were classified as narcoleptic (N) or non-narcoleptic (NN).

Thirty patients were studied, 12 were classified as narcoleptics (N group; 40%), while the remaining 18 as non-narcoleptic (NN group; 60%). Thirty MSLT were performed, resulting in 146 series. Sleep was detected in 126 series (86%) and dreams in 56 series (44.44%). Mean sleep time in the N group was 16.0+/-6.3 min, while 10.5+/-7.5 min in the NN group (p<0.0001). Mean sleep latency was 2.0+/-2.2 min and 7.2+/-6.0 min in the N and NN group, respectively (p<0.001). Mean REM sleep latency in the N group was 3.2+/-3.1min and 6.9+/-3.7 min in the NN group (p=0.021). Dreams occurred in 56.9% of the N group series and 28.4% in that of the NN group (p=0.0009).

Patients from the N group, compared to the NN group, slept longer and earlier, demonstrated a shorter REM sleep onset and greater dream frequency.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of modafinil on cognitive and thymopsychic variables in patients with narcolepsy and investigate whether neurophysiological vigilance changes correlate with cognitive and subjective vigilance alterations at the behavioral level. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, EEG-LORETA and psychometric data were obtained during midmorning hours in 15 narcoleptics before and after 3 weeks of placebo or 400 mg modafinil. Cognitive investigations included the Pauli Test and complex reaction time. Thymopsychic/psychophysiological evaluation comprised drive, mood, affectivity, wakefulness, depression, anxiety, the Symptom Checklist 90 and critical flicker frequency. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were performed too. Cognitive performance (Pauli Test) was significantly better after modafinil than after placebo. Concerning reaction time and thymopsychic variables, no significant differences were observed. Correlation analyses revealed that a decrease in prefrontal delta, theta and alpha-1 power correlated with an improvement in cognitive performance. Moreover, drowsiness was positively correlated with theta power in parietal and medial prefrontal regions and beta-1 and beta-2 power in occipital regions. A less significant correlation was observed between midmorning EEG LORETA and the MSLT; between EEG LORETA and the ESS, the correlation was even weaker. In conclusion, modafinil did not influence thymopsychic variables in narcolepsy, but it significantly improved cognitive performance, which may be related to medial prefrontal activity processes identified by LORETA.",2007.0

Retrospective case series.

One hundred sixty-three consecutive patients with unexplained sleepiness and 282 controls recruited at St. Vincent's Hospital, Korea. The gold standard for diagnosis was ICSD-2 criteria. Patients and controls completed the Stanford Sleep Inventory, and agreed to HLA typing. Polysomnography (87%), Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) (96%), and CSF hypocretin-1 measurements (53%) were conducted in patients.

Most patients (80%) could be classified using the ICSD-2. The 33 patients who could not be classified were without cataplexy (4 with low CSF hypocretin-1). These could not be included because of sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index > or = 5/h, 84%) and/or because sleep prior to MSLT was less than 6 hours (27%). Narcolepsy with cataplexy cases were 92% HLA positive with low hypocretin-1. Cataplexy at interview was predicted by validated Stanford Sleep Inventory questions regarding cataplexy triggers. In contrast, cataplexy-like events were frequently reported in all groups, including controls. Cases with narcolepsy without cataplexy were frequently men (73%) and heterogeneous biologically (36% HLA positive, 40% with low CSF hypocretin-1). None of the controls had low CSF hypocretin-1, whereas 13% were HLA positive.

The ICSD-2 was easily applicable in cases with typical cataplexy. In these cases, the MSLT and further evaluations were almost always positive and may thus not always be needed. Many patients without cataplexy were difficult to classify because of difficulties in interpreting the MSLT in the presence of sleep apnea or reduced sleep.",2006.0

Population-based sample.

N/A.

A population-based sample of 333 subjects was assessed by nocturnal polysomnography and daytime MSLT (5 naps), and an additional 206 subjectively sleepy people were also assessed (total = 539). Sample demographics were comparable to the 2000 census. Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were also determined. Groups were formed based on a median split of each sleep variable (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, MSLT, total sleep time from nocturnal polysomnography) for comparisons of SOREMPs in each group.

The prevalence of 2 or more SOREMPs was 3.9%. Only mean sleep latency on the MSLT was a discriminator for the presence of 2 or more SOREMPs (short latency = 6.3%, long latency = 1.9%, p < .05). Among the subjects who had an MSLT of 5 minutes or less (an indicator of a pathologic level of sleepiness), 9.5% had 2 or more SOREMPS.

The overall prevalence of 2 or more SOREMPs in our sample is 3.9%. Interestingly, of the variables assessed (MSLT, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and total sleep time from nocturnal polysomnography), objective sleepiness, as determined by the MSLT, was the only measure significantly associated with 2 or more SOREMPs. Therefore, subpopulations with excessive sleepiness (eg, shift workers, young adults, patients with apnea) are likely to have a greater prevalence of SOREMPs.",2006.0

Thirty-five patients, successively referred between 2002 and 2004, underwent polysomnography (PSG), repeat multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. Three patients without cataplexy also had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin measurements.

DQB1*0602 was associated with cataplexy in over 90% of Chinese-Taiwanese cases. Absence of cataplexy and <2 sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) was seen in only two subjects, but presence of two SOREMPs did not dissociate DQB1*0602 positive and negative or cataplexy positive and negative subjects. As a group, narcoleptics with cataplexy had a higher number of SOREMPs, and the mean sleep latency was much shorter in narcoleptics with cataplexy than in the non-cataplectic patients, independent of the number of SOREMPs.

Chinese-Taiwanese patients with cataplexy present with similar HLA findings as Black and Caucasian patients, but the presence of two or more SOREMPs in Chinese-Taiwanese patients is not a sufficient diagnostic tool to identify narcolepsy. When cataplexy is not present, description of PSG nd HLA findings may be a better approach than using a label with little scientific significance, allowing for better collection of patients' phenotype.",2006.0
16740406,Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) alterations in narcolepsy.,Terzano MG; Smerieri A; Del Felice A; Giglia F; Palomba V; Parrino L,2006 Dec,Sleep medicine,"Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder with clinical symptoms attributed to a reduced activation of the arousal system. Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) is the expression of rhythmic arousability during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. CAP parameters, arousals and conventional sleep measures were studied in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy.

Data were collected from all-night polysomnographic (PSG) recordings and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) on the intervening day of 25 drug-naive patients (10 males and 15 females; mean age: 34+/-16 years) after adaptation and exclusion of other sleep disorders. A group of 25 age- and gender-matched normal sleepers were selected as controls. Each PSG recording was subdivided into sleep cycles. Analysis of CAP included classification of A phases into subtypes A1, A2, and A3.

There was an increase in sleep period time mainly due to an increased wake time after sleep onset. REM latency was sharply reduced. The percentage of NREM sleep was slightly reduced and the balance between light sleep (S1+S2) and deep sleep (S3+S4) showed a curtailment of the former, while deep sleep was slightly increased. Excluding sleep cycles with sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs), the duration of ordered sleep cycles was not different between narcoleptics and controls. The two groups showed similar values of arousal index, while CAP time, CAP rate, number of CAP cycles and of phase A subtypes (in particular subtypes A1) were significantly reduced in narcoleptic patients.

The reduced periods of CAP in narcoleptic NREM sleep could be the electroencephalographic (EEG) expression of a generally reduced arousability or an increased strength of sleep-promoting forces in the balance between sleep and arousal systems. This can explain some of the clinical correlates of the disorder, i.e. excessive sleepiness, short sleep latency and impaired attentive performances, even without any sign of arousal-induced sleep fragmentation.",2006.0

Thirty-five (30%) displayed increased daytime sleepiness (ESS score > 10) of whom 14 were obese (26% of obese cohort). Polysomnography (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT) were conducted with 10 obese patients presenting increased daytime sleepiness, with only two craniopharyngioma patients revealing a sleep related breathing disorder. Four patients had repeated episodes of SOREM (sleep onset rapid eye movement), the classic PSG criterion for narcolepsy. Three patients displayed hypersomnia. All but one patient qualified as acutely obese.

We report on the prevalence and correlates of SOREMPs in the community-based Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study. MSLTs were conducted following nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and daily sleep diaries in 289 males and 267 females (age 35-70, 97% Caucasians). Multiple SOREMPs were observed in 13.1% of males and 5.6% of females. An MSLT mean sleep latency < or =8 min and > or =2 SOREMPs (diagnostic of narcolepsy) was observed in 5.9% (males) and 1.1% (females), all without cataplexy. Because of significant sex interactions, analyses were stratified by sex. Increased prevalence of HLA-DQB1*0602, a marker of narcolepsy, was observed in males but not in females with > or =2 SOREMPs. Males with multiple SOREMPs compared with those with no SOREMPs had shorter rapid eye movement (REM) latency during NPSG, were sleepier on the MSLT and reported increased sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy-like symptoms, suggesting a narcolepsy-like phenotype. In males only, the occurrence of SOREMPs increased with shift work and some indirect markers of sleep restriction, such as shorter sleep a day before NPSG. SOREMPs were unrelated to age, body mass index, depression (Zung Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Scale) and the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep (AHI), but were associated with decreased mean lowest oxygen saturation in males. Finally, we found that both males and females with SOREMPs reported taking more antidepressants, but those were of the types known not to suppress REM sleep. These results suggest a high prevalence of narcolepsy without cataplexy, as defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, and/or a large number of false-positives for the MSLT.",2006.0
16494086,Focusing on vigilance instead of sleepiness in the assessment of narcolepsy: high sensitivity of the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART).,Fronczek R; Middelkoop HA; van Dijk JG; Lammers GJ,2006 Feb,Sleep,"The severity of narcolepsy is commonly measured with the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), focusing on the tendency to fall asleep. A neglected but perhaps equally important complaint is impaired performance in the waking state. We evaluated the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) for the quantification of vigilance in narcolepsy.

The SART involves withholding key presses to 1 in 9 target stimuli. In the present study, it was administered prior to each of 5 MSLT sessions in a 1-day study. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was administered to measure subjective sleepiness. SART and MSLT results (number of errors and sleep latency) were compared using Receiver Operator Curves, sensitivity, and specificity.

Tertiary narcolepsy referral center in a university hospital.

Fifteen untreated narcoleptics and 15 matched controls.

None.

The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.97 for the MSLT and 0.95 for the SART. Sensitivity and specificity for the MLST were 80% and 100% using a cutoff point of 5 minutes. For the SART, these values were 87% and 100%, using a 5-error cutoff. The SART and MSLT showed no correlation with each other or with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.

The SART, measuring attention, was abnormal as often as the MSLT, measuring sleepiness. The inability to remain vigilant during the day may be the most serious complaint in narcolepsy, since it impairs performance. The SART is valid in this respect, is easy to administer, and takes little time.",2006.0

Cerebral perfusion was measured by brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer. Patients and normal controls had not received any medication prior to the SPECT scan. Differences in cerebral perfusion between narcoleptics and normal controls were subjected to statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis. Overnight polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were performed in all patients. Brain SPECT was carried out on all patients and normal controls during the waking state. Clinical symptoms and MSLT results of all patients are in accord with the International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria for narcolepsy. MSLT showed a short mean sleep latency (1.69 +/- 1.0 min) and 2-5 sleep onset REM periods in individual patient. SPM analysis of brain SPECT showed hypoperfusion of the bilateral anterior hypothalami, caudate nuclei, and pulvinar nuclei of thalami, parts of the dorsolateral/ventromedial prefrontal cortices, parahippocampal gyri, and cingulate gyri in narcoleptics [P < 0.05 by Student's t test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction]. Significant hypoperfusion in the white matter of frontal and parietal lobes was also noted in narcoleptics. This study shows reduced cerebral perfusion in subcortical structures and cortical areas in narcoleptics. The distribution of abnormal cerebral perfusion is concordant with the pathway of the cerebral hypocretin system and may explain the characteristic features of narcolepsy, i.e., cataplexy, emotional lability, and attention deficit.",2005.0
15935192,Narcolepsy and disorders of excessive somnolence.,Dyken ME; Yamada T,2005 Jun,Primary care,"Recent studies provide valid criteria that help differentiate idiopathic narcolepsy from other disorders of excessive daytime somnolence [3]. Research to date suggests that idiopathic narcolepsy might properly be considered a disorder of excessive sleepiness with dysfunctional REM-sleep mechanisms, clinically evidenced as cataplexy and electrophysiologically recognized as SOREMPs. Given these criteria, a diagnosis can generally be made using a combination of history, PSG, and MSLT. Traditionally, the medical treatment of idiopathic narcolepsy has centered on a two-drug regimen (stimulants for sleepiness and TCAs for cataplexy and auxiliary symptoms). Some newer medications are proving efficacious for sleepiness with minimal adverse effects, whereas others may provide a single-drug regimen that simultaneously addresses sleepiness and cataplexy [18]. New research has allowed some experts to hypothesize that idiopathic narcolepsy may be the result of a genetic predisposition to autoimmune disease [176]. It is possible that aberrant genetic coding of elements in the hypocretin/orexin systems allows a sensitivity to inducible and possibly virally mediated changes, which leave cells in the lateral hypothalamus susceptible to autoimmune attack [96]. As such, genetic screening of high-risk individuals might eventually rationalize the prophylactic use of immunosuppressants in some instances. In the future, for atypical cases(poorly responsive to therapy), genetic, CSF, and brain imaging studies, and possibly even neuronal transplantation may prove beneficial in the assessment and treatment of idiopathic narcolepsy.",2005.0
15823167,Difference in the characteristics of subjective and objective sleepiness between narcolepsy and essential hypersomnia.,Komada Y; Inoue Y; Mukai J; Shirakawa S; Takahashi K; Honda Y,2005 Apr,Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,"The present study was conducted to investigate the difference in the characteristics of daytime sleepiness between narcolepsy and essential hypersomnia and to identify the relationship between the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) in patients with these two disorders. Subjects consisted of 34 patients with essential hypersomnia (32.4 +/- 11.0 years old), 52 patients with narcolepsy (29.0 +/- 13.8 years old), and 45 control subjects (33.3 +/- 6.6 years old). The subjects completed the ESS and underwent MSLT following a regular sleep-wake schedule for over 2 weeks. The ESS scores were pathologically high and mean sleep latency on MSLT was short, not only in narcolepsy but also in essential hypersomnia. With respect to sleep latencies on each MSLT session, both essential hypersomnia and control subjects had the smallest value at 14:00, while narcolepsy lacked any statistical change at this time period. The correlation between ESS and mean sleep latency on MSLT was higher in essential hypersomnia than in narcolepsy, and the correlation was strongest for the session performed at 14:00. Based on the ESS and MSLT results, the severity of excessive daytime sleepiness was significantly milder in essential hypersomnia compared with that in narcolepsy. The results also indicate that diurnal variation of sleepiness was maintained, and the correlation between subjective and objective sleepiness was relatively maintained in essential hypersomnia compared to narcolepsy. It is suggested that the mild disease severity of essential hypersomnia contributed to the formation of these characteristics.",2005.0
15729517,Parkinsonism with excessive daytime sleepiness--a narcolepsy-like disorder?,Baumann C; Ferini-Strambi L; Waldvogel D; Werth E; Bassetti CL,2005 Feb,Journal of neurology,"Parkinsonian patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), short mean sleep latencies, and sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMP) on multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) have been reported. In these patients a narcolepsy-like pathophysiology of sleep-wake disturbances has been suggested.

We studied 14 consecutive patients with Parkinsonism and EDS. Standard studies included assessment of duration and severity of Parkinsonism (Hoehn & Yahr score), Epworth sleepiness score (ESS), history of ""REM-symptoms"" (RBD/hallucinations/sleep paralysis/cataplexy-like episodes), polysomnography (PSG), MSLT, and measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocretin-1 (orexin A).

There were 12 men and 2 women (mean age 69 years; range 54-82). The mean duration and the Hoehn&Yahr score were 6.3 years and 2.2, respectively. Diagnoses included idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD, n = 10), dementia with diffuse Lewy bodies (n = 3), and multisystem atrophy (n = 1). The ESS was > or = 10 in all patients (mean 12; range 10-18). ""REM-symptoms"" were reported by all but two patients (hallucinations: n = 9; RBD: n = 9). None of the patients reported cataplexy-like symptoms or sleep paralysis. On PSG sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index > 10/h, n = 7), periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS-index > 10/h, n = 6), and features of RBD (n = 5) were found. On MSLT mean sleep latency was < 5 minutes in 10 patients, and SOREMP were found in two patients. When compared with controls (n = 20, mean 497 pg/ml; range 350-603), CSF hypocretin-1 levels were normal in 8 patients and low in 2 patients (221 and 307 pg/ml, respectively).

These findings do not support the hypothesis of a ""final common pathway"" in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy and Parkinsonism with EDS. Sleep apnea and PLMS may play a so-far underestimated role in the pathogenesis of EDS in Parkinsonian patients.",2005.0

We also ventured to investigate the differences between narcolepsy with and without cataplexy.

Data were collected retrospectively from patients diagnosed with narcolepsy at the Sleep Disorder Unit of Singapore General Hospital over 5 years. Each patient had had a detailed clinical evaluation and overnight polysomnography (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).

A total of 28 cases were studied. Males made up 85.7% of the total and females, 14.3%. The mean age was 30.9 years. All had excessive daytime sleepiness. Other manifestations were cataplexy (48.1%), sleep paralysis (51.9%), hypnogogic hallucinations (84%), disturbed night sleep (29.2%), automatisms (17.4%) and catnaps (95.8%). The mean duration of symptoms was 7.24 years. In the MSLT, the mean values for mean sleep latency and number of sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMP) were 4.3 minutes and 2.7, respectively. Narcolepsy was associated with obstructive sleep apnoea and periodic limb movement disorder (35.7%). All the variables were compared between those who had narcolepsy with cataplexy and without cataplexy. The duration of presenting complaint, REM latency, respiratory disturbance index, number of SOREMPs and the presence of sleep paralysis were significantly different in the 2 groups.

Narcolepsy predominantly affects young males. Concurrence of other sleep disorders is not uncommon. Some differences are evident between those who have narcolepsy with and without cataplexy.",2005.0
15700728,The clinical use of the MSLT and MWT.,Arand D; Bonnet M; Hurwitz T; Mitler M; Rosa R; Sangal RB,2005 Jan,Sleep,"The studies examined in this review indicate that the MSL is sensitive to conditions expected to increase sleepiness. MSL are generally lower following sleep loss, following use of sedating medications, during wakefulness in the late night or early morning hours, and among patients with sleep disorders associated with excessive sleepiness such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. However, the wide range in MSL makes it difficult to establish a specific threshold value for excessive sleepiness or to discriminate patients with sleep disorders from non-patients. Some of this variation may be attributable to methodological differences and some may be attributable to individual differences in sleep tendency (e.g., related to age). The studies analyzed in this review indicate that the MSL on both the MSLT and MWT does not discriminate well between patients with sleep disorders and normal populations. This is due to large SD as well as floor or ceiling effects in the tests. However, the MSL shows appropriate change from initial testing to subsequent testing following treatment or manipulations intended to alter sleepiness or alertness. Additionally the presence of two or more SOREMPs on the MSLT is a common finding in narcolepsy patients. However, SOREMPs are not exclusive to narcolepsy patients but are frequent in untreated sleep apnea",2005.0

These practice parameters were developed to guide the sleep clinician on appropriate clinical use of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). These recommendations replace those published in 1992 in a position paper produced by the American Sleep Disorders Association. A Task Force of content experts was appointed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to perform a comprehensive review of the scientific literature and grade the evidence regarding the clinical use of the MSLT and the MWT. Practice parameters were developed based on this review and in most cases evidence based methods were used to support recommendations. When data were insufficient or inconclusive, the collective opinion of experts was used to support recommendations. These recommendations were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The MSLT is indicated as part of the evaluation of patients with suspected narcolepsy and may be useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected idiopathic hypersomnia. The MSLT is not routinely indicated in the initial evaluation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, or in assessment of change following treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The MSLT is not routinely indicated for evaluation of sleepiness in medical and neurological disorders (other than narcolepsy), insomnia, or circadian rhythm disorders. The MWT may be indicated in assessment of individuals in whom the inability to remain awake constitutes a safety issue, or in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia to assess response to treatment with medications. There is little evidence linking mean sleep latency on the MWT with risk of accidents in real world circumstances. For this reason, the sleep clinician should not rely solely on mean sleep latency as a single indicator of impairment or risk for accidents, but should also rely on clinical judgment. Assessment should involve integration of findings from the clinical history, compliance with treatment, and, in some cases, objective testing using the MWT. These practice parameters also include recommendations for the MSLT and MWT protocols, a discussion of the normative data available for both tests, and a description of issues that need further study.",2005.0

Measurements comprised LORETA, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) obtained before and after three weeks' therapy. Statistical overall analysis by means of the omnibus significance test demonstrated significant inter-group differences in the resting (R-EEG), but not in the vigilance-controlled recordings (V-EEG). Subsequent univariate analysis revealed a decrease in alpha-2 and beta 1-3 power in prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices, with the right hemisphere slightly more involved in this vigilance decrement. Modafinil 400 mg/d as compared with placebo induced changes opposite to the aforementioned baseline differences (key-lock principle) with a preponderance in the left hemisphere. This increase in vigilance resulted in an improvement in the MSLT and the ESS.

15560774,The clinical spectrum of narcolepsy with cataplexy: a reappraisal.,Sturzenegger C; Bassetti CL,2004 Dec,Journal of sleep research,"In the absence of a golden standard for the diagnosis of narcolepsy, the clinical spectrum of disorder remains controversial. The aims of this study were (1) to determine frequency and characteristics of sleep-wake symptoms in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, (2) to compare clinical characteristics with results of ancillary tests, and (3) to identify factors that discriminate narcolepsy from other conditions with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). We prospectively studied 57 narcoleptics with cataplexy, 56 patients with non-narcoleptic hypersomnia (H), and 40 normal controls (No). Based on suggested and published criteria, we differentiated between narcoleptics with definite cataplexy (N) and narcoleptics without definite cataplexy (possible cataplexy, NpC). Assessment consisted of questionnaires [all patients and controls, including the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Score (UNS)], polysomnography (all patients), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and human leukocyte antigen typing (in most narcoleptics). A new narcolepsy score based on five questions was developed. Data were compared with those of 12 hypocretin-deficient narcoleptics (N-hd). There were significant differences between N and NpC (including mean sleep latency on MSLT), but none between N and N-hd. A score of sleep propensity during active situations (SPAS) and the frequency of sleep paralysis/hallucinations at sleep onset, dreams of flying, and history of sleep shouting discriminated N from H and No (P < 0.001). Cataplexy-like symptoms in H (18%) and No (8%) could be discriminated from 'true' cataplexy in N on the basis of topography of motor effects, triggering emotions and triggering situations (P < 0.001). Our narcolepsy score had a similar sensitivity (96% versus 98%) but a higher specificity (98% versus 56%) than the UNS. Analysis of co-occurring symptoms in narcolepsy revealed two symptom complexes: EDS, cataplexy, automatic behaviors; and sleep paralysis, hallucinations, parasomnias. Low/undetectable cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and a history of definite cataplexy identify similar subgroups of narcoleptics. Specific questions on severity of EDS (SPAS score) and characteristics of cataplexy allow the recognition of subgroups of narcoleptics and their differentiation from non-narcoleptic EDS patients, including those reporting cataplexy-like episodes. The existence of co-occurring symptoms supports the hypothesis of a distinct pathophysiology of single narcoleptic symptoms.",2004.0

In 16 drug-free narcoleptics and 16 normal controls a baseline 3-min vigilance-controlled EEG (V-EEG) and a 4-min resting EEG (R-EEG) were recorded during midmorning hours. Thereafter, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, patients were treated with a 3-week fixed titration of modafinil (200, 300, 400 mg) and placebo. EEG-mapping, MSLT and ESS measures were obtained before and at the end of the third week of therapy. Statistical overall analysis by means of the omnibus significance test demonstrated significant EEG differences between untreated patients and controls in the resting condition only (R-EEG). Subsequent univariate analysis revealed an increase in absolute and relative theta power, a decrease in alpha-2 and beta power as well as a slowing of the dominant frequency and the centroids of the alpha, beta and total power spectrum and thus objectified a vigilance decrement in narcolepsy. Modafinil 400 mg/d significantly improved vigilance as compared with placebo (p < or = 0.01), inducing changes opposite to the aforementioned baseline differences (key-lock principle). The MSLT and the ESS also improved under modafinil as compared with placebo, but changes were less consistent. Spearman rank correlations revealed the highest correlations between EEG mapping and the ESS, followed by those between EEG mapping and the MSLT, while the lowest correlation was found between the MSLT and the ESS. In conclusion, EEG mapping is a valuable instrument for measuring vigilance decrements in narcolepsy and their improvement under psychostimulant treatment.",2005.0

The present study aimed to investigate the diagnostic basis of childhood narcolepsy and possible role of HLA Class II alleles in the onset of this disease.

The clinical data of 40 narcoleptic children were analyzed. All patients received Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and they were analyzed in combination with clinical features. Polymerase chain reaction/sequence specific primers (PCR/SSP) methods were used to detect the HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles.

Narcolepsy was diagnosed in 40 children. The age range was 3 to 14 years (mean 8.5 +/- 2.5 years), 29 were male and 11 female. Their mean course of disease was 6.5 months, 14 patients (30%) were less than 3 months old, 21 patients (52%) were less than 6 months old. All the patients had excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy appeared in 37 cases, hypnagogic hallucination in 22 and sleep paralysis in 6. Mean sleep latency on MSLT was less than 5 min, the average number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) was 4.33 +/- 0.26 episodes (2-5 episodes), the latency of SOREM episodes were 4.0 +/- 1.8 min (0.25-4.9 min). Thirty-five patients were DRB1 1501 and DQB1 0602 positive (Pc < 0.01), 2 were DRB1 1502 and DQB1 0601 positive, while 3 were DRB1 15 and DQB1 6 negative.

Some pediatric patients with narcolepsy were different from adult patients in that the pediatric cases had a sudden onset and shorter disease course. Diagnosis of this disease was based on the clinical manifestations, MSLT and absence of any medical or psychiatric disorder that could account for the symptoms. The authors demonstrated that DRB1 1501 and DQB1 0602 were susceptibility genes for narcolepsy and those who were DRB1 15 negative could not be excluded.",2004.0

In this case study presentation the patient suffered a head trauma, without unconsciousness, and began to experience unusual episodic behaviours. Symptom presentation differed from the typical clinical manifestations of idiopathic narcolepsy leading to an 8-year search for a definitive diagnosis. Key relevant aspects that led to diagnostic ambiguities were the order of symptom development, negative for the antigen HLA DR2, significance of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) mean sleep latency versus number of sleep onset rapid eye movement periods, the somewhat atypical features of cataplexy, the coexistence of sleep apnoea, and the mildness of the original head injury.

Clinical and polygraphic information on the severity of the condition was obtained on 236 well-defined narcolepsy-cataplexy-human leukocyte antigen DR2-positive patients from Montpellier (France) and on 147 similar patients from Montreal (Canada).

The results show a progressive decrease in the number of SOREMP with age and a progressive increase in the mean sleep latency on the MSLT as a function of age. This finding is also related to the severity of cataplexy as assessed from the clinical history with a progressive decrease in the frequency of cataplexy attacks with age. These results may reflect the progressive increase in sleep latency seen in normal aging and suggest that clinical improvement might be due to changes in the neural mechanisms responsible for SOREMP, which may weaken with age.

The progressive decrease in the number of SOREMP and increase in the mean sleep latency on the MSLT as a function of age suggest that the current criteria used for diagnosis may be too stringent in older patients. The major influence of age on MSLT results should therefore be taken into account when diagnosing a narcoleptic patient.",2004.0

There are no studies examining the long-term effects and safety profile of modafinil in children with excessive daytime somnolence (EDS).

To determine the effects of modafinil on clinical manifestations of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.

A systematic chart review was conducted for 13 children (mean age 11.0+/-5.3 years, six males, 10 with narcolepsy and three with idiopathic hypersomnia) receiving modafinil.

The mean modafinil dose was 346+/-119 mg/day, with a mean treatment duration of 15.6+/-7.8 months. For approximately 90% of the children treated, parents reported a favorable response with the reduction in sudden sleep attacks, as documented by sleep-wake diaries. One child failed to improve on 400 mg/day modafinil and was switched to methylphenidate. Two other children showed only partial improvement and required additional stimulant medication to control EDS symptoms. Seven children underwent repeated nocturnal polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT). Compared to baseline MSLT measures (mean sleep latency: 6.6+/-3.7 min), modafinil prolonged mean sleep latency (10.2+/-4.8 min, p=0.02) without significant alteration in nocturnal polysomnographic measures. However, a trend towards REM sleep reduction was noted (16.8+/-5.1%TST vs. 11.8+/-6.2%TST).

The clinical borderland of narcolepsy and the diagnostic value of different markers of narcolepsy remain controversial and were assessed in a consecutive series of 27 patients with hypersomnia of (mainly) neurological origin.

Diagnoses included classical narcolepsy (n=3), symptomatic narcolepsy (n=1), narcolepsy without cataplexy (n=4), idiopathic hypersomnia (n=5), hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders (n=5), and hypersomnia secondary to neurological disorders or of undetermined origin (n=9). Clinical assessment included BMI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS), and history of REM-symptoms (sleep paralysis, hallucinations). HLA-typing, electrophysiological studies (conventional polysomnography, MSLT, 1-week actigraphy), and measurements of CSF levels of hypocretin and leptin were also performed.

Hypocretin-1 was undetectable in three patients with classic narcolepsy and detectable in the remaining 24 patients. Other narcoleptic markers also frequently found in patients without narcolepsy included ESS>14 (78% of 27 patients), UNS>14 (75%), REM symptoms (30%), sleep latencies on MSLT<5 min (41%), >/=2 SOREM (30%), DQB1*0602 positivity (52%), BMI>25 (52%), and increased CSF leptin (48%). Hypersomnia was documented by an increased time 'asleep' in 41% of patients. Overlapping clinical and electrophysiological findings were seen mostly in patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and psychiatric hypersomnia.

(1) Hypocretin dysfunction is not the 'final common pathway' in the pathophysiology of most hypersomnolent syndromes that fall on the borderline for a diagnosis of narcolepsy. (2) The observed overlap among these hypersomnolent syndromes implies that current diagnostic categories are not entirely unambiguous. (3) A common hypothalamic, hypocretin-independent dysfunction may be present in some of these syndromes.",2003.0

12696996,"Narcolepsy in the older adult: epidemiology, diagnosis and management.",Chakravorty SS; Rye DB,2003,Drugs & aging,"Narcolepsy is a disorder of impaired expression of wakefulness and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. This manifests as excessive daytime sleepiness and expression of individual physiological correlates of REM sleep that include cataplexy and sleep paralysis (REM sleep atonia intruding into wakefulness), impaired maintenance of REM sleep atonia (e.g. REM sleep behaviour disorder [RBD]), and dream imagery intruding into wakefulness (e.g. hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations). Excessive sleepiness typically begins in the second or third decade followed by expression of auxiliary symptoms. Only cataplexy exhibits a high specificity for diagnosis of narcolepsy. While the natural history is poorly defined, narcolepsy appears to be lifelong but not progressive. Mild disease severity, misdiagnoses or long delays in cataplexy expression often cause long intervals between symptom onset, presentation and diagnosis. Only 15-30% of narcoleptic individuals are ever diagnosed or treated, and nearly half first present for diagnosis after the age of 40 years. Attention to periodic leg movements (PLM), sleep apnoea and RBD is particularly important in the management of the older narcoleptic patient, in whom these conditions are more likely to occur. Diagnosis requires nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) followed by multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT). The NPSG of a narcoleptic patient may be totally normal, or demonstrate the patient has a short nocturnal REM sleep latency, exhibits unexplained arousals or PLM. The MSLT diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy include short sleep latencies (<8 minutes) and at least two naps with sleep-onset REM sleep. Treatment includes counselling as to the chronic nature of narcolepsy, the potential for developing further symptoms reflective of REM sleep dyscontrol, and the hazards associated with driving and operating machinery. Elderly narcoleptic patients, despite age-related decrements in sleep quality, are generally less sleepy and less likely to evidence REM sleep dyscontrol. Nonpharmacological management also includes maintenance of a strict wake-sleep schedule, good sleep hygiene, the benefits of afternoon naps and a programme of regular exercise. Thereafter, treatment is highly individualised, depending on the severity of daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and sleep disruption. Wake-promoting agents include the traditional psychostimulants. More recently, treatment with the 'activating' antidepressants and the novel wake-promoting agent modafinil has been advocated. Cataplexy is especially responsive to antidepressants which enhance synaptic levels of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and/or serotonin. Obstructive sleep apnoea and PLMs are more common in narcolepsy and should be suspected when previously well controlled older narcolepsy patients exhibit a worsening of symptoms. The discovery that narcolepsy/cataplexy results from the absence of neuroexcitatory properties of the hypothalamic hypocretin-peptidergic system will significantly advance understanding and treatment of the symptom complex in the future.",2003.0

To delineate the spectrum of the hypocretin deficiency syndrome and to establish CSF hypocretin-1 measurements as a diagnostic tool for narcolepsy.

Diagnosis, HLA-DQ, clinical data, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and CSF hypocretin-1 were studied in a case series of patients with sleep disorders from 1999 to 2002. Signal detection analysis was used to determine the CSF hypocretin-1 levels best predictive for International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD)-defined narcolepsy (blinded criterion standard). Clinical and demographic features were compared in narcoleptic subjects with and without low CSF hypocretin-1 levels.

Sleep disorder and neurology clinics in the United States and Europe, with biological testing performed at Stanford University, Stanford, Calif.

There were 274 patients with narcolepsy; hypersomnia; obstructive sleep apnea; restless legs syndrome; insomnia; and atypical hypersomnia cases such as familial cases, narcolepsy without cataplexy or without HLA-DQB1*0602, recurrent hypersomnias, and symptomatic cases (eg, Parkinson disease, depression, Prader-Willi syndrome, Niemann-Pick disease type C). The subject group also included 296 controls (healthy and with neurological disorders).

Diagnostic threshold for CSF hypocretin-1, HLA-DQB1*0602 positivity, and clinical and polysomnographic features.

HLA-DQB1*0602 frequency was increased in narcolepsy with typical cataplexy (93% vs 17% in controls), narcolepsy without cataplexy (56%), and in essential hypersomnia (52%). Hypocretin-1 levels below 110 pg/mL were diagnostic for narcolepsy. Values above 200 pg/mL were considered normal. Most subjects with low levels were HLA-DQB1*0602-positive narcolepsy-cataplexy patients. These patients did not always have abnormal MSLT. Rare subjects without cataplexy, DQB1*0602, and/or with secondary narcolepsy had low levels. Ten subjects with hypersomnia had intermediate levels, 7 with narcolepsy (often HLA negative, of secondary nature, and/or with atypical cataplexy or no cataplexy), and 1 with periodic hypersomnia. Healthy controls and subjects with other sleep disorders all had normal levels. Neurological subjects had generally normal levels (n = 194). Intermediate (n = 30) and low (n = 3) levels were observed in various acute neuropathologic conditions.

Narcolepsy-cataplexy with hypocretin deficiency is a genuine disease entity. Measuring CSF hypocretin-1 is a definitive diagnostic test, provided that it is interpreted within the clinical context. It may be most useful in cases with cataplexy and when the MSLT is difficult to interpret (ie, in subjects already treated with psychoactive drugs or with other concurrent sleep disorders).",2002.0

The population consisted of 15 males and 15 females with mean age of 36 years (range: 16-60 years). Twenty-one patients had had hypersomnolence for more than 2 years. All patients underwent a single night polysomnography (PSG) and a 4-nap multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). PSG was normal in 23 patients. Sleep onset REM period (SOREMP) was defined as the occurrence of REM sleep within 15 min. after initiation of sleep. PSG demonstrated SOREMP's in only 1 patient and showed evidence of obstructive sleep apnea in 4 patients. Two patients had a low sleep efficiency. MSLT demonstrated hypersomnolence in 17 patients of whom 6 showed SOREMP. Significant hypersomnolence was defined as a mean sleep latency < or = 5 min. 4 patients fulfilled the classical clinical and polygraphic criteria (> or = 2 SOREMP) of narcolepsy. In 8 patients the tentative diagnosis of idiopathic CNS hypersomnolence was made. 13 patients did not sleep during MSLT. These results emphasize the relative importance of MSLT. Our limited 4-nap MSLT protocol proved useful in distinguishing narcolepsy from idiopathic CNS hypersomnolence.",2002.0

Recent observations have implicated the hypocretin/orexin system in narcolepsy in both humans and animals. In addition, the implication of monoaminergic systems in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy is well established and a significant association between the monoamine oxydase-A (MAO-A) gene and human narcolepsy has recently provided a possible genetic link. We investigated polymorphisms of MAO-A and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in 97 Caucasians with well-defined narcolepsy-cataplexy and sought for genotypic effects on disease symptoms. No evidence of association between genotype or allele frequencies of both MAO-A or COMT gene and narcolepsy was found. However, a sexual dimorphism and a strong effect of COMT genotype on disease severity were found. Women narcoleptics with high COMT activity fell asleep twice as fast as those with low COMT activity during the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) while the opposite was true for men. COMT genotype also strongly affected the presence of sleep paralysis and the number of REM sleep onsets during the MSLT.

Because of concern regarding driving safety, we evaluated the incidence and nature of somnolence experienced by patients receiving pramipexole in clinical trials at our center. A retrospective chart review was performed and structured interviews were conducted with patients who had reported moderate or severe somnolence. In addition, two patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) while on and 2 weeks after discontinuation of pramipexole. Forty patients with PD participating in pramipexole clinical trials were identified. In the double-blind phases of the studies, 22 patients were randomized to pramipexole and 18 were randomized to placebo. Six patients assigned to pramipexole reported somnolence as an adverse event (1 moderate, 5 mild) compared with two patients assigned to placebo (1 severe, 1 moderate; p = 0.19, one-tailed Fisher's exact test). Thirty-seven patients participated in open-label extension studies. Twenty-one (57%) reported somnolence as an adverse event. Eleven (30%) patients reported moderate somnolence and three (8%) patients reported severe somnolence. For patients with moderate or severe somnolence, the onset of worst-reported somnolence occurred at a mean (+/- standard error) pramipexole dose of 4.0 +/- 0.4 mg (range, 0.75-4.5 mg) per day. Patients had been taking pramipexole for a total of 10.0 +/- 1.5 months (range, .03-22 mos) and at their maximal dose for 6.7 +/- 1.5 months (range, .03-20 mos). During structured interviews with 12 of the 14 patients reporting moderate or severe somnolence, seven reported falling asleep while driving and two reported minor motor vehicle accidents caused by falling asleep. Most patients reported relatively continuous drowsiness that led to falling asleep without acute warning during periods of inactivity. Three patients reported discreet waves of irresistible sleepiness heralded by prodromal symptoms occurring against a background of normal wakefulness. MSLT in two of these patients revealed decreased latency to sleep without early onset of rapid eye movements. Sleep latency normalized after withdrawal of pramipexole. Intensive patient education is necessary to prevent motor vehicle accidents in patients taking pramipexole. We recommend that patients who are experiencing generalized drowsiness and falling asleep during periods of inactivity be instructed not to drive because these patients do fall asleep without acute warning. Somnolence usually resolves with pramipexole dose reduction or discontinuation. Patients should also be alerted to pull over and stop driving immediately if they feel a wave of sleepiness coming on.

10673181,Sleep onset REM periods during multiple sleep latency tests in patients evaluated for sleep apnea.,Chervin RD; Aldrich MS,2000 Feb,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,"Although 2 or more sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (2omSOREMPs) on a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) raise the possibility of narcolepsy, patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) also can have 2omSOREMPs, which may then cause diagnostic uncertainty. To explore what features among OSA patients predict 2omSOREMPs on an MSLT that follows nocturnal polysomnography, we reviewed data from 1,145 consecutively studied patients suspected or confirmed to have OSA rather than narcolepsy. Overall, 4.7% of the subjects had 2omSOREMPs. Variables that were independently predictive of 2omSOREMPs in logistic regression models included male gender (OR = 4.4, 95% CI = 1.9 to 12.7), a 5-min decrease in the MSLT-derived mean sleep latency (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3 to 2.8), a 90-min decrease in nocturnal latency to REM sleep (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1 to 2.5), and a 15-unit decrease in minimal recorded oxygen saturation (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.3 to 2.0). We conclude that among patients suspected or confirmed to have OSA, one or more of these four variables-male sex, sleepiness, nocturnal REM sleep latency, and extent of oxygen desaturation-could reflect neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for 2omSOREMPs. Consideration of these variables, and especially gender, may be useful in clinical practice when 2omSOREMPs are found unexpectedly.",2000.0
10616118,Subjective sleepiness ratings (Epworth sleepiness scale) do not reflect the same parameter of sleepiness as objective sleepiness (maintenance of wakefulness test) in patients with narcolepsy.,Sangal RB; Mitler MM; Sangal JM,1999 Dec,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,"To evaluate whether subjective (Epworth Sleepiness Scale or ESS) and objective (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or MWT) tests of sleepiness are equally useful in patients with narcolepsy.

Correlational study evaluating the relationship between ESS and MWT as measures of sleepiness.

Multi-center.

522 patients (17-68 year old men and women) with a current diagnosis of narcolepsy.

None.

Correlations were: MSLT and MWT, r = 0.52 (P<0.001); MWT and ESS, r = -0.29 (P<0.001); MSLT and ESS, r = -0.27 (P<0.001). Regression curve estimation using linear and curvilinear models revealed no difference among linear and curvilinear models between MWT and MSLT, and between MSLT and ESS. However, curvilinear models were better at explaining the relationship between MWT and ESS, with the cubic model being the best. As the level of severe sleepiness (as measured by the MWT) changed, the ESS remained stable.

In a large narcolepsy sample, the MWT and ESS are not equally useful, and do not measure the same parameter of sleepiness.",1999.0
10534906,Clinico-polysomnographic diagnostics of narcolepsy-cataplexy.,Zachariev Z; Djurkova A,1999,Folia medica,"The introduction of polysomnography changed considerably our knowledge about narcolepsy. The aim of our study was to present the clinical picture and diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy based on our own research data.

The study comprises 22 consecutive patients with a mean age of 39.8 years, SD = 16.4, age range 7-78 years. The following methods were used: neurological, physical and mental status examination, specially designed questionnaires, nocturnal polysomnography, MSLT.

The following clinical manifestations were observed: excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in 95.45% of the cases, cataplexy attacks (CA) in 77.27%, hypnagogic hallucinations (HH)--in 77.27%, sleep paralysis (SP)--in 54.54% and subjectively disturbed nocturnal sleep--in 72.72%. The mean ages of occurrence of the respective symptoms were as follows: EDS--32.14 +/- 10.15 years, CA--28.70 +/- 11.70 years, HH--36.70 +/- 8.82 years, SP--35.53 +/- 15.50 years and for the disease as a whole--39.82 +/- 15.50 years. At MSLT the mean sleep latency was 165.91 +/- 16.37 seconds and the mean REM latency--207.96 +/- 14.09 seconds. During the nighttime sleep the mean sleep latency was less than 5 minutes and the mean REM latency--less than 7 minutes. The sleep structure showed: NREM sleep, stage 1,2--66.30 +/- 4.1%, stage 3,4--5.52 +/- 4.1%, REM sleep--25.65 +/- 2.3%. The clinical picture presented 4 symptoms in 31.81%, 3 symptoms--in 50.00%, 2 symptoms--in 9.09% and 1 symptom in 9.09% of the cases.

1. The onset of narcolepsy is at about 30 years of age. 2. The clinical picture of narcolepsy is characterized by 2 major symptoms--excessive daytime sleepiness, attacks of cataplexy and 3 minor symptoms--sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations and disturbed nighttime sleep which may be found in various combinations. 3. Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrates characteristic changes in sleep structure. 4. MSLT ascertains shorter sleep latency and sleep onset rapid eye movements periods (SOREMs) of less than 5 minutes. 5. The presence of one of the major symptoms and SOREMs is sufficient for confirming the diagnosis of narcolepsy.",1999.0

Patients with narcolepsy were then administered baseline polysomnograms and objective (MSLT, Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or MWT) and subjective tests (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Clinical Global Impression) of daytime sleepiness. Patients had longer 31-electrode mean age-adjusted auditory P300 latencies (406.0 +/- 27.8 vs. 385.7 +/- 28.9 ms, p = 0.012) and visual P300 latencies (427.3 +/- 29.0 vs. 411.4 +/- 27.7 ms., p = 0.044) than 40 normal subjects in the same age range. Age-adjusted auditory P300 latency was correlated with MWT (r = -0.49, p = 0.028), but not with any other clinical variable or measure of sleepiness. Age-adjusted visual P300 latency was not correlated with any clinical variable or measure of sleepiness.

All probands and first-degree relatives received clinical and laboratory evaluations as well as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. Demographic characteristics of the 32 probands are as follows: 17 males and 15 females; mean age was 42.1 years (range 13-70 years). The polysomnographic data confirmed daytime sleepiness and increased tendency for REM sleep for the 32 probands. Nocturnal polysomnographic results are as follows: sleep latency, 3.2 minutes; total sleep time, 442 minutes. MSLT results are as follows: sleep latency, 3.1 minutes; REM latency, 6.9 minutes; number of REM periods, 3.2. HLA typing revealed the presence of the HLA haplotypes, DRB1*15 and DQB1*0602, in 21 narcoleptic probands, with two African-Americans having the DQB1*0602 but not the DRB1*15 allele. Among the 57 relatives of the 32 probands, 1/31 females and 7/26 males were found to be affected with narcolepsy (p < 0.02), which suggests a higher diagnostic rate in male relatives. The 21 probands who were positive for the DRB1*15 and DQB1*0602 haplotypes did not differ from the 10 probands who were negative for these alleles in terms of their nocturnal sleep parameters, MSLT findings, or clinical presentation. Three families with multiple individuals affected with narcolepsy are presented. Two families have more than one affected individual who does not have the high-risk HLA haplotype. In one of these families, the disease is segregating independently of any HLA haplotype. In the third family, there is cosegregation with HLA DRB1*15 and DQB1*0602. One family contains a pair of DNA-confirmed, monozygotic twins with narcolepsy who are discordant for cataplexy and have the HLA DR14(Dw9)/DQB1*0503 and DR4(Dw4)/DQB1*0302 haplotypes.",1997.0
9351129,Value of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) for the diagnosis of narcolepsy.,Aldrich MS; Chervin RD; Malow BA,1997 Aug,Sleep,"Since its introduction, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) has played a major role in the diagnosis of narcolepsy. We assessed its diagnostic value in a series of 2,083 subjects of whom 170 (8.2%) were diagnosed with narcolepsy. The sensitivity of the combination of two or more sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) with a mean sleep latency of < 5 minutes on an initial MSLT was 70% with a specificity of 97%, but 30% of all subjects with this combination of findings did not have narcolepsy. In some narcoleptics who had more than one MSLT, the proportion of naps with SOREMPs varied substantially from the initial MSLT to the follow-up test. The highest specificity (99.2%) and positive predictive value (PPV) (87%) for MSLT findings was obtained with the criteria of three or more SOREMPs combined with a mean sleep latency of < 5 minutes, but the sensitivity of this combination was only 46%. The combination of a SOREMP with a sleep latency < 10 minutes on polysomnography yielded a specificity (98.9%) and PPV (73%) almost equal to those obtained from combinations of MSLT findings, but the sensitivity was much lower. Our results suggest that the MSLT cannot be used in isolation to confirm or exclude narcolepsy, is indicated only in selected patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, and is most valuable when interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings.",1997.0
9322269,"Performance, ability to stay awake, and tendency to fall asleep during the night after a diurnal sleep with temazepam or placebo.",Porcù S; Bellatreccia A; Ferrara M; Casagrande M,1997 Jul,Sleep,"Sleep loss and increased sleepiness on the job are among the most prevalent problems encountered by people involved in night shift work, especially in cases of abrupt shift of the wake-sleep cycle. In such conditions, detrimental effects on performance are well documented. In these situations, to avoid decrements of performance at night, one possibility is to use hypnotics for improving the quality and quantity of daytime sleep. In this study, we evaluated the effects of 20 mg of temazepam on daytime sleep, the subsequent levels of nocturnal alertness/sleepiness, and performance in a laboratory simulation of acute night shift. For evaluating alertness, sleepiness, and performance we used, respectively, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and two pencil and paper tests: digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and deux barrages test (DBT). All tests were administered four times at 2-hour intervals during the nighttime after daytime sleep. Results showed that the ability to maintain wakefulness (MWT) and to perform some visuo-attentive tasks were substantially maintained during the night. On the other hand, sleep tendency (MSLT) linearly increased during the night. Temazepam resulted in being an effective diurnal hypnotic, increasing total sleep time with no residual detrimental effects on sleepiness and performance and with an increase in the ability to stay awake.",1997.0
9241473,"Measurement of P300 and sleep characteristics in patients with hypersomnia: do P300 latencies, P300 amplitudes, and multiple sleep latency and maintenance of wakefulness tests measure different factors?",Sangal RB; Sangal JM,1997 Jul,Clinical EEG (electroencephalography),"To explore further the relationship between ease of falling asleep, ability to maintain wakefulness, attention and information processing in sleep apnea and other sleep disorders, we conducted a thorough analysis of the similarities, differences and correlations between auditory and visual P300 amplitudes and latencies, and tests of sleepiness. The 283 consecutive patients presenting with hypersomnia were administered nocturnal polysomnography. Next day they underwent auditory and visual P300 recordings, Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). Correlation coefficients were calculated between auditory and visual P300 amplitudes and latencies, respiratory disturbance index (RDI), sleep efficiency, % stage 1, and the tests for sleepiness. Factor analysis was performed with data from P300 testing, MSLT and MWT. Auditory P300 amplitude was correlated with sleep efficiency. Auditory P300 latency was correlated with % stage 1, RDI, MSLT and MWT. Visual P300 latency was correlated with % stage 1, sleep efficiency and MWT. MSLT but not MWT was negatively correlated with sleep efficiency. Factor analysis suggests three factors: attention, information processing, and sleepiness. We conclude that P300 latencies and tests of sleepiness (MSLT and MWT) measure different abilities in patients with diagnosable disorders of daytime sleepiness.",1997.0
9191765,HLA DR15 (DR2) and DQB1*0602 typing studies in 188 narcoleptic patients with cataplexy.,Rogers AE; Meehan J; Guilleminault C; Grumet FC; Mignot E,1997 Jun,Neurology,"Narcolepsy is considered a homogeneous clinical entity when excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy are present. Cataplexy is a polymorphic symptom that can be very mild and is thus subjectively defined. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is widely used as a diagnostic test for narcolepsy. A short mean sleep latency and multiple sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) are typically observed in narcoleptic patients. The discovery of a tight association of narcolepsy with HLA class II antigens offers a unique opportunity to explore the respective value of the MSLT or of the presence of clear-cut cataplexy in defining an etiologically homogeneous group of narcoleptic patients. In this study, we carried out HLA typing for DR15(DR2) and DQB1*0602 in 188 narcoleptic patients with cataplexy in three ethnic groups (24 Asians, 61 Blacks, and 103 Caucasians). These results confirm the importance of DQB1*0602 typing rather than DR15 (DR2) typing in Black narcoleptic patients and demonstrate that the presence of clear-cut cataplexy is a better predictor for DQB1*0602 positivity than the presence of abnormal MSLT results.",1997.0
9231951,The alpha attenuation test: assessing excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy-cataplexy.,Alloway CE; Ogilvie RD; Shapiro CM,1997 Apr,Sleep,"Daytime sleep tendency was assessed in 10 drug-free patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 10 normals matched for age and gender. Following nocturnal polysomnography, the alpha attenuation test (AAT) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were administered during five sessions occurring at 2-hour intervals beginning at 0900 and 1000 hours, respectively. For the AAT, participants were polysomnographically recorded for 8 minutes while seated in an illuminated room with their eyes alternately opened and closed. Power spectral analyses of electroencephalograph (EEG) activity at 02-A1 (10 second epochs) were calculated using fast Fourier transformations (FFT) within the alpha frequency range (8-12 Hz) to obtain ratios of mean eyes-closed to mean eyes-open alpha power (i.e. the alpha attenuation coefficient, AAC). The narcoleptics were sleepier than the normals as indicated by a significantly smaller mean AAC and a significantly shorter mean latency to stage 1 on the MSLT. These findings suggest that the AAT may provide a quick and practical objective assessment of the excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy.",1997.0

All narcoleptic patients had been previously diagnosed [mean sleep latency on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) < or = 5 minutes with two or more sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs)]. Healthy, normal subjects with a mean sleep latency on the screening MSLT > or = 8 minutes were randomly assigned to one of two groups (i.e. sleep-deprived and alert). All subjects completed two experimental night and days with at least 5 days between sessions. On the evening prior to each experimental day, narcoleptic and alert subjects spent 8 hours in bed and sleep-deprived subjects spent 0 hours in bed. The following day, all subjects underwent one of two napping conditions, 15 or 120 minutes in bed. Both naps were terminated at noon. Every subject underwent both conditions and the order of conditions was counterbalanced. From 1215 to 1355 hours all subjects underwent a modified MSLT. At 1500 hours, the subjects had a 1-hour nap. The results showed that the 120-minute nap condition was more beneficial than the 15-minute nap. Narcoleptic and sleep deprived subjects were shown to have comparable levels of sleepiness on the modified MSLT. However, a differential response pattern on their latency to sleep was noted on the 1-hour nap. Sleep-deprived subjects were shown to be differentially more alert following a 120-minute nap opportunity. In contrast, for narcoleptic patients the beneficial effects of the nap were lost when tested 3 hours later. These results show that narcoleptic patients benefit from a longer nap but that these benefits are short-lived.",1997.0

We analyzed relations among ESS scores, mean sleep latencies on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and subjective assessments of severity of sleepiness in 60 patients (34 women) with suspected excessive daytime sleepiness. Mean scores were 14.2 +/- 5.9 on the ESS and 8.3 +/- 5.2 minutes on the MSLT. ESS scores correlated negatively, but not strongly, with MSLT scores (rho = -0.37, p = 0.0042) and ESS scores of 14 and above predicted a low mean sleep latency on the MSLT. The ESS score correlated with the degree to which patients complained of sleepiness and may be useful as an otherwise elusive link between patients' complaints and their objective findings on MSLT.",1997.0
9122558,Comparison of simulated driving performance in narcolepsy and sleep apnea patients.,George CF; Boudreau AC; Smiley A,1996 Nov,Sleep,"Many patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or narcolepsy have difficulty driving and increased automobile accidents. Previously we have shown that OSA patients perform poorly on a laboratory-based divided-attention driving test (DADT). Patients with narcolepsy may be as sleepy as OSA patients, so we compared performance on the DADT of OSA patients with that of narcolepsy patients. Twenty-one male OSA patients [age 49.3 +/- 12.7 (SD) years; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 73 +/- 29] 21 age- and sex-matched controls, and 16 narcoleptics (12 males, four females; age 39.6 +/- 15.2 years) underwent polysomnography followed by daytime sleep latency testing (MSLT). Following a practice session, all subjects were given the DADT for 20 minute prior to each daytime nap of the MSLT. Narcolepsy patients were younger than OSA or controls and more sleepy than OSA patients. Tracking error was much worse in patients than controls (228 +/- 145 cm for OSA vs. 196 +/- 146 for narcolepsy vs. 71 +/- 31 for controls; p < 0.001), although half of either patient group performed as well as controls. There was only a weak relationship between MSLT and tracking in either patient group. We conclude that impairment in laboratory driving performance skills is seen in both groups of sleepy patients but the degree of impairment is difficult to predict from sleepiness alone.",1996.0
8899938,Relationship between sleepiness and general health status.,Briones B; Adams N; Strauss M; Rosenberg C; Whalen C; Carskadon M; Roebuck T; Winters M; Redline S,1996 Sep,Sleep,"One commonly used instrument for evaluating general health and functional status is the medical outcomes survey short form 36 (MOS). Scores obtained from this instrument are known to vary with chronic diseases and depression. However, the degree to which these health dimensions may be influenced by sleep quality or sleepiness is not well understood. A cross-sectional study was performed on the association between general health status, as determined by the MOS, with sleepiness, assessed using a standardized questionnaire [the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS)] and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). One hundred twenty-nine subjects (68 women), aged 25-65 years, without severe chronic medical or psychiatric illnesses, underwent an overnight sleep study, followed by an MSLT (consisting of a series of four attempts at napping at 2-hour intervals), and completed the MOS and the ESS. The mean MSLT score was 11 +/- 2 minutes, (range 2-20) and the mean ESS score was 10 +/- 5 (range 0-24). Scores for the MOS dimensions ""general health perceptions"", ""energy/fatigue"", and ""role limitations due to emotional problems"" were correlated significantly with ESS scores (r = -0.30, -0.41, and -0.30, respectively; p values were all < 0.001). The MSLT was also significantly correlated with ""energy/fatigue"" (r = -0.19; p < 0.05). After considering the effects of chronic illness and/or body mass index in a multiple hierarchical regression analysis, sleepiness, as assessed by the ESS score, explained 8% of the variance in general health perceptions, 17% of the variance in energy/fatigue, 6% of the variance in the summary measure of well-being, and 3% of the variance in the summary measure of functional status. The variation of MOS scores with sleepiness, unrelated to age or chronic disease, suggests that measures of general health status may be broadly influenced by sleepiness and sleep quality. These data suggest that 1) sleepiness has an important impact on general health and functional status, specifically influencing self-perceptions regarding energy/fatigue; 2) a more specific assessment of sleepiness in general health evaluations may help explain some of the observed variability in these measures across subjects; and 3) general health measures may be useful in the evaluations of patients with sleep disorders.",1996.0

The diagnosis of narcolepsy was based on clinical symptoms and polysomnographic signs. Control subjects were screened before participation and were split based on their screening multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) into high- and low-MSLT groups. Subjects completed two polysomnographic evaluations with at least 5 days between laboratory tests. Narcoleptics had lower sleep efficiencies and high stage 1% when compared to the low MSLT control group. They had more awakenings and less stage 2% than the control groups. Narcoleptics had a shorter latency to 1 when compared to the high-MSLT group but comparable to that of the low-MSLT group. Narcoleptics had a higher number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) than both control groups. The MSLT scores were stable across the two evaluations and showed a statistically significant correlation. Twenty-eight of the 30 narcoleptic subjects had two or more SOREMPs on reevaluation. None of the controls had multiple SOREMPs. Thus, multiple SOREMPs were shown to be a reliable finding in patients with narcolepsy.",1996.0
8723379,Are periodic leg movements associated with clinical sleep disturbance?,Mendelson WB,1996 Apr,Sleep,"We examined 67 patients with periodic leg movement (PLM) disorder who were seen in a university-based sleep center. The most common reasons for coming to the sleep center were insomnia, sleepiness and a request for an evaluation for possible sleep apnea. There was a significant positive correlation between PLM arousal index and age but no association with gender. Approximately one-quarter of patients were under age 30. The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) revealed borderline normal wakefulness in the group as a whole (sleep latency of 10.2 +/- 0.9 minutes), and there was no significant correlation between the PLM arousal index and either the MSLT mean sleep latency or a measure of subjective sleepiness. Similarly, the PLM arousal index did not differentiate those who entered with chief complaints of insomnia or sleepiness. There was no significant difference in the PLM arousal index in those who reported that they did or did not awaken refreshed in the morning. In summary, in this clinical population we found no significant association between the PLM arousal index and the subjective complaint of disturbed sleep, an objective measure of daytime sleepiness or a sense of awakening refreshed in the morning. Other interesting observations included the relatively high frequency of a PLM index > 5 in patients under 30 years old and a relatively high rate of past treatment for depression.",1996.0
8855030,Overestimation of sleep latency by patients with suspected hypersomnolence.,Chervin RD; Guilleminault C,1996 Feb,Sleep,"The latency to sleep onset has been reported to be overestimated by chronic insomniacs. Observing that some patients evaluated for suspected hypersomnolence complain of insomnia and others fail to report that they are sleepy, we wondered whether overestimation of sleep latency could be occurring in these subjects as well. Since polysomnography (PSG) only provides one sleep onset with which to assess a patient's estimation, we investigated the use of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) for this purpose. Among 147 patients who had an MSLT, 137 of whom had a preceding PSG, overestimation of sleep latency occurred on 78% and 74% of the respective tests. The magnitude of overestimation averaged 3 minutes and 27 minutes, respectively, and was not dependent on diagnosis. Subjects who had reported a history of difficulty falling asleep, compared to those who did not, tended to show equivalent objective sleep latencies, longer subjective nocturnal sleep latencies and less overall accuracy in their estimates. Those who denied having a problem with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) showed objective sleep latencies nearly identical to those who complained of EDS but had only a trend toward higher overestimation on the MSLT. Overestimation of sleep latency is therefore more readily part of an explanation for why hypersomnolent patients sometimes complain of insomnia than it is for failure to recognize EDS. The MSLT as well as nocturnal recordings can provide data with which to assess overestimation of sleep latency.",1996.0
9012160,[Performance and personality of patients with hypersomnia].,Mayer G; Leonhardt E,1996,Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),"5 groups of patients with hypersomnia (narcolepsy, posttraumatic, psychophysiologic, idiopathic hypersomnia and circadian sleep-wake disorders) were tested with a battery of psychometric tests (FPI, MMPI, BVND, BIV, Benton, d2, WIP), visual vigilance test, polysomnography and MSLT in order to investigate the context between personality and performance. MSLT showed a range from clear pathologic to borderline sleep latencies among all groups, only patients with posttraumatic hypersomnia and narcolepsy displayed sleep onset REM. Correct results of vigilance tests correlated negatively with performance-motivation and orientation in patients with narcolepsy and posttraumatic hypersomnia, whereas there was positive correlation for patients with idiopathic hypersomnia. In patients with psychophysiologic hypersomnia performance orientation and false reactions correlate negatively. Patients with posttraumatic hypersomnia have better results on d2. Benton and vigilance tests than all other groups. Results of personality diagnosis are similar to those of healthy subjects, while patients with psychophysiologic hypersomnia are more sensible than all other groups with high social fears and the highest disposition among all groups toward somatic complaints. Patients with idiopathic hypersomnia show strong introversion and inhibition. Patients with circadian sleep-wake disorders display the most striking personality disorders, which are most probably sequelae of their strong disease-dependent impairment. The degree of personality disorder seems to be strongly dependent on the duration of the hypersomnias. The assessment of the whole set of tests can only be recommended for patients with psychophysiologic hypersomnia and circadian sleep-wake disorders, a few tests suffice to describe the other groups.",1996.0
8746399,Should we be taking more sleep?,Harrison Y; Horne JA,1995 Dec,Sleep,"Reports of reduced daytime sleepiness following extended nighttime sleep in normal, regular sleepers suggest that they (and perhaps much of the general population) are chronically sleep deprived. However, 1) the social and environmental contexts of sleep allow for much intraindividual variation in sleep duration and structure; 2) animal studies show that when there is opportunity for sleep and few incentives to remain awake, sleep occurs for reasons other than in response to a physiological requirement, i.e. sleep satiation may precede actual awakening, 3) accounts of increased sleep duration earlier this century are flawed and 4) because increased sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset are features of extended sleep, it would be difficult to persuade people to sleep longer for the small benefits to daytime alertness. Laboratory studies show that 1) following extended sleep the improvements in daytime alertness are minor, even by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and could be achieved equally successfully and with less disruption to habitual daily patterns by taking a short nap; 2) normal subjects extend sleep at night not necessarily because they are chronically sleepy, because there may be no prior MSLT signs of daytime sleepiness; 3) mood effects of extended sleep are confounded by earlier bedtimes; and 4) extended sleep does not necessarily make subjects feel well rested immediately on waking. In sum, most people are not chronically sleep deprived but have the capacity to take more sleep, in the same way that we eat and drink in excess of physiological needs.",1995.0

The correlation structure between all study variables was explained by a simple model of daytime sleepiness. The model suggested that indicators of psychophysiological arousal (psychological distress, nocturnal motor activity and serum thyrotropin level) and daytime reported tiredness, body mass index (BMI) and age were related significantly and independently to MSLT-defined daytime sleepiness. The arousal theory of insomnia and poor sleep in relation to MSLT behavior is discussed and the need of a multivariate approach is emphasized in MSLT studies.",1995.0

A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.",Mayer G; Ewert Meier K; Hephata K,1995 Aug,Clinical neuropharmacology,"The relative benefits of selegeline hydrochloride (2 x 5 mg, 2 x 10 mg selegeline) were studied in 30 narcoleptic patients using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups (placebo and 2 x 5 mg and 2 x 10 mg selegeline). After a 2-week washout period for previous anticataplectic and stimulant medication, the study started with a 2-day period of placebo intake for each group, continued by 14 days of medication, ending with a 2-day placebo period. Outcome was measured by comparison of four polysomnographies and four multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) performed during the initial and the final placebo and medication period. Each MSLT day included acoustic and visual vigilance tests. Blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored daily. Patients reported daily about mood, concentration, subjective sleep time, nocturnal awakenings, nocturnal wake times, number of naps, and occurrence of symptoms of the narcoleptic tetrad. Selegeline caused dose-dependent REM suppression during nighttime sleep and naps and increase of sleep and REM latency. Under selegeline, daytime sleepiness improved significantly and the number of sleep attacks and naps as well as the frequency of cataplexy were reduced. Selegeline at a dose of a least 20 mg/day is a potent drug for the treatment of all narcoleptic symptoms.",1995.0
7676167,Mean versus median for the multiple sleep latency test.,Benbadis SR; Perry M; Wolgamuth BR; Turnbull J; Mendelson WB,1995 Jun,Sleep,"Since its introduction in the mid-1970s, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) has become the standard method for evaluating hypersomnolence. The mean sleep latency is usually calculated and constitutes the traditional basis for interpretation. Mean and median are both measures of the central tendency of a distribution, but because the trials of the MSLT are limited to 20 minutes, the median may be more appropriate. The objective of this study was to compare the value of the mean versus the median sleep latency in the interpretation of the MSLT. We retrospectively analyzed 100 MSLTs performed for evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness. Patients' ages ranged from 6 to 84 years (mean 43). Mean and median sleep latencies were calculated according to standard formulas. We classified each record into one of three categories, using both the mean and the median sleep latencies: normal (> 10 minutes), moderate (> or = 5 and < or = 10 minutes), and severe sleepiness (< 5 minutes). Of the 100 MSLTs, 89 remained in the same category (normal, moderate, severe) whether mean or median was used. In 11 cases, the category changed. All shifts were by one category, that is, no shift occurred between normal and severe. This study suggests that, despite valid theoretical arguments for the use of the median, both measures are equally acceptable for clinical purposes.",1995.0

We performed A-EEG using the Medilog 9000-8 channel system over a total of 36 24-hour periods in 20 consecutive N/C patients and recorded an average of 3.5 daytime sleep episodes, of which 2.2 were with SOREMP, AND 21 evening SOREMP (58%). A MSLT was performed using A-EEG in 16 cases. Continuous A-EEG proved to be more informative than the MSLT, and may represent a valid alternative to the classic continuous polygraphic recordings performed in the sleep lab, that are more cumbersome and costly. Although a full-night polysomnographic recording is still necessary whenever other sleep disorders are suspected in association with N/C, A-EEG is a first-line, practical method for the confirmation of N/C, which remains a clinical diagnosis.",1995.0

The present study is concerned with one particular type of secondary narcolepsy, posttraumatic narcolepsy, which we define as ""narcolepsy that develops following a head injury in a previously asymptomatic individual"". We obtained data on nine patients who had been previously diagnosed with mild to moderate closed head injury and who had unresolved sleep complaints. All patients presented with complaints of excessive daytime somnolence and/or sleep attacks. Patients also presented with a mix of cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations and/or sleep paralysis. All patients had undergone previous neurological and/or neuropsychological evaluation and testing, with seven of the nine patients having the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) tissue typing was obtained in six of the nine cases. The standard protocol was utilized, consisting of overnight polysomnography with a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) the following day. All patients' histories were negative for narcolepsy or any other significant sleep disorders prior to the head injury. The results of the neuropsychological testing indicated that all patients fell within the mild to moderate impairment range. The results of overnight polysomnography and MSLT data, along with patient histories, indicated a diagnosis of narcolepsy in all cases. The results of HLA typing indicated that three patients were DR2 positive, two were DR4 positive and one was DQW1 positive. We conclude that narcolepsy may be ""dormant"" and that, in cases genetically at risk, even a minor injury to the central nervous system can cause that person to become symptomatic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994.0
7701190,Evaluation of treatment with stimulants in narcolepsy.,Mitler MM,1994 Dec,Sleep,"This paper briefly reviews sleep laboratory studies on the treatment efficacy of methylphenidate, pemoline, dextroamphetamine and methamphetamine. The literature indicates that 1) methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, pemoline and methamphetamine objectively improve somnolence as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency or Maintenance of Wakefulness Tests (MSLT or MWT); 2) pemoline, at doses up to 112.5 mg, is less effective in controlling somnolence than methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine and methamphetamine; 3) there are dose-dependent improvements in performance that parallel MSLT and MWT data; and 4) at the highest doses of stimulants studied to date, narcoleptics, although improved, still did not function on MSLT or MWT and most performance tests at levels comparable to those of control subjects. Future research designs should address issues of placebo effect, practice effects and the degree to which alertness and performance measures can be pharmacologically brought up to levels comparable to those of normal control subjects.",1994.0
7701189,Controversies in the diagnosis of narcolepsy.,Guilleminault C; Mignot E; Partinen M,1994 Dec,Sleep,"The diagnosis of narcolepsy can be problematic. Most sleep laboratories use polygraphic testing to establish the diagnosis. One polygraphic recording followed by a single multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is used to differentiate the causes of syndromes with complaints of daytime somnolence. Prospective investigations have demonstrated that patients with periodic leg movements or upper airway resistance syndrome may present abnormal sleep latencies and more than one sleep onset rapid eye movement period (SOREMP) during MSLT. On the other hand, investigations of patients with daytime sleepiness and cataplexy have shown that the MSLT may not show more than one SOREMP. The combination of history of cataplexy and more than one SOREMP during MSLT is the best clinical determinant of narcolepsy. History of daytime sleepiness and presence of more than one SOREMP during MSLT, however, is a poorer discriminant of narcolepsy than history of cataplexy, particularly in an aging population.",1994.0
7701181,Sleepiness in different situations measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.,Johns MW,1994 Dec,Sleep,"This investigation examines how the sleep propensity (SP) in one test situation, such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), is related to sleepiness in daily life, as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This is a self-administered questionnaire, the item scores from which provide a new method for measuring SPs in eight different real-life situations. The ESS item scores were analyzed separately in four groups of subjects: 150 adult patients with a variety of sleep disorders, 87 medical students who answered the ESS on two occasions 5 months apart, 44 patients who also had MSLTs and 50 patients whose spouses also answered the ESS about their partner's sleepiness. The ESS item scores were shown to be reliable (mean rho = 0.56, p < 0.001). The SP measured by the MSLT was related to three of the eight item scores in a multiple regression (r = 0.64, p < 0.001). The results of nonparametric ANOVA, Spearman correlations, Wilcoxon's t tests, item and factor analysis suggest that individual measurements of SP involve three components of variation in addition to short-term changes over periods of hours or days: a general characteristic of the subject (his average SP), a general characteristic of the situation in which SP is measured (its soporific nature) and a third component that is specific for both subject and situation. The SP in one test situation, including the MSLT, may not be a reliable indicator of a subject's average SP in daily life. Perhaps we should reexamine the current concept of daytime sleepiness and its measurement.",1994.0

Despite the widely reported strong association with HLA DR2 among different ethnic groups and their varying prevalence rates, there has never been any series of laboratory documented narcolepsy in Chinese.

To report the preliminary experience with Chinese narcoleptic patients and their HLA typing.

The records of 342 patients who presented to our sleep laboratory for various sleep problems from 1986 to 1992 were examined. Both clinical and polysomnographic data were analysed. The criteria for a diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on shortened mean sleep latency of less than 5 minutes and presence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in two or more of the five 20-minute naps during multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).

There were five narcoleptic patients documented resulting in an overall laboratory prevalence of 1.5% or 2.3% of patients presenting with hypersomnia. All patients were HLA DR2 positive.

There is 100% association with HLA DR2 in Hong Kong Chinese narcoleptic patients. Based on the laboratory prevalence, the prevalence rate of narcolepsy among Hong Kong Chinese population is estimated to be within the range of four in 10,000 to one in 100,000.",1994.0
8178031,Daytime sleepiness and cognitive functioning in sleep apnea.,Mitler MM,1993 Dec,Sleep,"Our earliest findings relating sleepiness to cognitive function revealed that, among patients with the symptom of excessive somnolence, sleep apneics were the most impaired on cognitive tasks. Although the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) has been the standard diagnostic test for assessing daytime sleepiness, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) has clinical advantages over the MSLT when the assessment of daytime alertness is the primary goal. A number of studies on patients with sleep apnea and narcolepsy indicate that the MWT is more sensitive to treatment-related improvements in sleepiness. However, sleep tendency, as measured by the MSLT, and ability to remain awake, as measured by the MWT, probably represent the same physiological process viewed from different perspectives. Some patients, particularly those who have received suboptimal treatment, will show no treatment-related improvement in daytime sleepiness if they are evaluated only by the MSLT. We believe that the MWT and MSLT measure different aspects of the central problem of abnormal sleep tendency. The MWT may be a useful adjuvant daytime test in clinical situations where it is necessary to quantify degree of impairment or effectiveness of treatment.",1993.0

In both patients MSLT documented a markedly increased daytime sleep propensity during the attacks without augmented REM sleep pressure. Both patients share the same HLA haplotype (HLA-DR1, DQ1) which has been found in Kleine-Levin syndrome. This makes these subtypes of recurrent hypersomnia indistinguishable one from the other, under the immunogenetic profile, but permits differentiation from narcolepsy which is HLA-DR2, DQ1 closely linked.",1993.0
7691539,Validation of computer analysed polygraphic patterns during drowsiness and sleep onset.,Hasan J; Hirvonen K; Värri A; Häkkinen V; Loula P,1993 Sep,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,"A computer system for the automatic analysis of polygraphic records was validated. Records from 9 subjects made during routine MSLT tests were analysed both by two preliminary and one consensus scorer and by a computer system. Special attention was paid to the analysis of drowsiness periods. Therefore a classification system including 7 stages, three for wakefulness and movement, one for drowsiness and three for the sleep stages S1, S2 and SREM was used. Adaptive segmentation was used to divide the records into short segments of variable length (mean 1.6 sec, range 0.5-13.7 sec). The agreements between the computer and visual scores were relatively good for 5 subjects having a prominent occipital alpha activity during wakefulness (range 70-79%) but less promising (range 64-70%) for the other 4 subjects with ""poor"" occipital alpha activity. The values obtained corresponded to the inter-scorer agreements. Most of the discrepancies were between adjacent stages. At times in the presence of strongly fluctuating EEG amplitudes and especially with the ""low-alpha"" subjects it was very difficult to determine exactly even by visual scoring when, for instance, drowsiness became sleep. It is concluded that the reliability of the system is sufficient for practical purposes especially if critical parts of the records are visually reexamined. It was found to be difficult to define unambiguous scoring criteria for subjects with poorly defined EEG rhythms giving insufficient landmarks for stage determination.",1993.0
8341891,Treatment of narcolepsy with methamphetamine.,Mitler MM; Hajdukovic R; Erman MK,1993 Jun,Sleep,"Eight pairs of subjects (each consisting of a narcoleptic and a control matched on the basis of age, sex, educational background and job) were evaluated under the following double-blind, randomized treatment conditions: baseline, placebo, low dose and high dose methamphetamine. Subjects were drug-free for 2 weeks prior to beginning the protocol. Methamphetamine was the only drug taken during the protocol and was given in a single morning dose of 0, 20 or 40-60 mg to narcoleptics and 0, 5 or 10 mg to controls. The protocol was 28 days long, with each of the four treatment conditions lasting 4 days followed by 3 days of washout. Nighttime polysomnography and daytime testing were done during the last 24 hours of each treatment condition. Daytime sleep tendency was assessed with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Daytime performance was assessed with performance tests including a simple, computer-based driving task. Narcoleptics' mean MSLT sleep latency increased from 4.3 minutes on placebo to 9.3 minutes on high dose, compared with an increase from 10.4 to 17.1 minutes for controls. Narcoleptics' error rate on the driving task decreased from 2.53% on placebo to 0.33% on high dose, compared with a decrease from 0.22% to 0.16% for controls. The effects of methamphetamine on nocturnal sleep were generally dose-dependent and affected sleep continuity and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Elimination half life was estimated to be between 15.9 and 22.0 hours. Mild side effects emerged in a dose-dependent fashion and most often involved the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. We concluded that methamphetamine caused a dose-dependent decrease in daytime sleep tendency and improvement in performance in both narcoleptics and controls. Methamphetamine at doses of 40-60 mg allowed narcoleptics to function at levels comparable to those of unmedicated controls.",1993.0
8423911,The positive diagnosis of narcolepsy and narcolepsy's borderland.,Moscovitch A; Partinen M; Guilleminault C,1993 Jan,Neurology,"We studied the validity of cataplexy and number of sleep-onset rapid-eye-movement periods (SOREMPs) during one Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) as determinants of narcolepsy in 306 subjects with excessive daytime sleepiness not related to obstructive sleep apnea or other known syndromes. The subgroup defined by a history of cataplexy was the most homogeneous in clinical and polygraphic variables. However, only 83% of these subjects had two or more SOREMPs in one MSLT. The subgroup defined by two or more SOREMPs included many patients without cataplexy. A disproportionate number of these subjects were older women whose chances of developing cataplexy are remote. This group of older women had a higher number of periodic leg movements during sleep than the other groups. Patients with both cataplexy and two or more SOREMPs have the greatest chance of being DR2 DQw1 positive. Thus, the combination of history of cataplexy and two or more SOREMPs is the best clinical determinant of narcolepsy. However, two or more SOREMPs is a poorer discriminant of narcolepsy than history of cataplexy.",1993.0

The intention of the present study was to investigate the structure of MSLT naps and in particular sleep spindle and k-complex density in three different groups of EDS patients. MSLT was performed at 8 a.m., 10 a.m. 12 a.m., 2. p.m. and 4 p.m.. Each recording lasted 20 minutes and was not stopped even if sleep occurred before 20 min. Sleep was scored visually. Spindle and k-complex density was determined per minute of S2 sleep. Statistical analysis used ANOVA. Each of the three groups consisted of 15 patients. Diagnosis of narcolepsy, sleep apnea, of EDS due to a psychiatric disorder has been confirmed subsequently. There were 5 female and 10 male narcoleptics (mean age: 43.9 +/- 10.9 years), 2 female and 13 male obstructive sleep apnea patients (mean age: 53.9 +/- 10.9 years) and 7 female and 8 male patients complaining of EDS, in whom a psychiatric disorder was diagnosed (mean age: 38.8 +/- 13.8 years). Narcoleptics sent more than half of the recording time of 100 min asleep (52.9%). Apnea patients slept 41.3% and psychogenic EDS patients 22.7%. The proportion of sleep stages 1 and 2 in narcoleptics (S2/S1 = 1:1) was clearly different from the other two (apnea patients: S2/S1 = 4:1; psychogenic EDS patients: S2/S1 = 3:1). 18.5% of the naps contained stage REM and during the afternoon naps 0.9% of S3 in the narcoleptics.

1521410,Evaluation of daytime sleepiness.,Moldofsky H,1992 Sep,Clinics in chest medicine,"In summary, the evaluation of the tired patient requires an awareness of the various meanings of tiredness. Furthermore, it is important to differentiate normal sleepiness that is a product of circadian rhythm variation in vigilance from pathologic sleepiness. Sleepiness that results from faulty habits, e.g., altered sleep scheduling, drugs, or sleep restriction, can be readily discerned with the aid of a sleep-wake diary. Because subjective sleepiness is often unappreciated, especially in patients with sleep apnea, methods that rely on self-ratings of the severity of sleepiness, e.g., visual analogue scale, 10-cm line, or SSS may not coincide with performance tasks, observer assessments, or such physiologic methods as the MSLT. Less commonly employed neurophysiologic methods include pupillometry and averaged evoked potentials. On the other hand, the MSLT is commonly used for the detection of physiologic sleepiness. Moreover, it is helpful in evaluating response to treatment. A variation of the MSLT, the MWT, which instructs the individual to remain awake, does not discriminate between sleep onset times for wakefulness and the MSLT for sleepiness in normal subjects. The MWT may be useful for the assessment of treatment responses for excessive daytime sleepiness, e.g., narcolepsy, and for determining the frequency of daytime sleep episodes. The differences that have been observed between behavioral measures and physiologic measures of sleepiness suggest that these techniques assess different aspects of sleepiness. HLA typing (DR2, DQw1) has been shown to be a useful method for corroborating narcolepsy-cataplexy, but the antigens are neither specific for the disorder nor for sleepiness alone.",1992.0

The two treatment periods, L-dopa or placebo, lasted for 2 weeks each, separated by a 1-week washout period. In addition to the standard Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), two different tests assessed the daytime vigilance: the Analogue Vigilance Scale (AVS) and the Four Choice Reaction Time Test (FCRTT). L-dopa improved vigilance and performance as evaluated by the AVS and the FCRTT, while the capacity to fall asleep rapidly remained unchanged as evaluated by the MSLT. Results of the present study suggest that L-dopa is effective in improving the vigilance level of narcoleptic patients and raises the hypothesis that dopamine may play a role in the physiopathology of excessive daytime sleepiness of this condition.",1991.0

Statistically and clinically significant therapeutic changes were apparent for pemoline, modafinil, dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate. Codeine, ritanserin and protriptyline did show statistically significant effects.

Twenty narcolepsy patients were given an overnight polysomnogram (PSG), followed by a daytime multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) at baseline and on the 1st and 29th days of GHB and placebo treatment. The overnight PSGs indicated that the narcolepsy patients had the following significant results during GHB versus placebo treatment: decreased stage 1 (p = 0.012), increased stage 3 (p = 0.008), increased delta (stage 3 and 4 combined) sleep (p = 0.049), fewer stage shifts (p = 0.002), and fewer awakenings (p = 0.006). Minutes of wakefulness were significantly increased only for the last 2 h of the 8 h sleep period on GHB versus placebo (p = 0.019), which is beyond the time of GHB's direct influence. The MSLTs indicated that the narcolepsy patients had a marginally increased sleep latency mean during GHB versus placebo treatment (p = 0.074) and significantly increased total stage 0 (wakefulness) on day 29 of GHB versus day 29 of placebo treatment (p = 0.038). Female narcolepsy patients had significantly fewer naps with REM sleep (REM naps) on day 29 of GHB vs. day 29 of placebo treatment (p = 0.020). The therapeutic effect of GHB in narcolepsy patients, i.e., decreases cataplexy, appears to be due to its improving nocturnal sleep quality, since its half-life is only 1.5 to 2 h. It is conjectured that GHB, an endogenous neurochemical, may be a sleep neurotransmitter or neuromodulator, since GHB rapidly induces sleep, and increases sleep continuity and delta sleep without suppressing REM sleep in both normals and narcolepsy patients.",1990.0

But, as indicated by family studies, other factors contribute to the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. The investigation of monozygotic twins is the most specific research tool for distinguishing between a multigenetic and a multifactorial pathogenetic model. We present clinical and sleep polygraphic data from two pairs of monozygotic twins, and in addition, from some of their first-degree relatives. In both pairs only one twin suffered from the clinical symptoms of narcolepsy/cataplexy. Only in these subjects did night sleep recordings and a multiple sleep latency test reveal both multiple sleep onset rapid-eye-movement periods (SOREMPs) and short mean sleep onset latencies. However, in two of the asymptomatic, HLA DR2+ relatives, short mean sleep onset latencies during the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were observed, and one, HLA DR2- relative showed REM sleep two times during the MSLT. Our results strongly favor a multifactorial pathogenetic model for narcolepsy.",1990.0

The questionnaire inquired regarding the present, previous, and change in status for the constellation of narcolepsy symptoms. Memory problems, problems of daytime function, and nocturnal sleep disturbance were included among the questions related to the symptomatic constellation. By definition, all patients were symptomatic of daytime sleepiness and were diagnosed with narcolepsy only if there were two or more rapid eye movement (REM) onsets documented on the polysomnographic evaluation. A high percentage of patients reported nocturnal sleep disturbance, which was one of the symptoms with the latest reported onset. Retrospective comparison of questionnaire responses to the clinical polysomnography revealed significantly more sleep maintenance difficulties in the group of patients reporting this symptom on the questionnaire. Patients with disturbed nocturnal sleep reported taking more naps during the day, although the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) failed to show differences in sleep latency. Interestingly, this group of patients was found to have a significantly higher number of sleep onset REM episodes on the MSLT. Finally, the findings are discussed as they compare to studies that required the presence of cataplexy as part of their inclusion criteria.",1990.0
3238257,A comparison of multiple and single sleep latency and cerebral evoked potential (P300) measures in the assessment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy-cataplexy.,Broughton R; Aguirre M; Dunham W,1988 Dec,Sleep,"A direct comparison was made between the amplitude of evoked potential (EP) component P3 (by the P300 paradigm), a known sensitive EP correlate of sleepiness, and sleep latency measures (both to stage 1 or rapid eye movement [REM] and to stage 2 or REM) of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) in 11 untreated narcoleptics and matched controls. Repeated P3 measures were performed immediately prior to standard MSLT naps at 10:00 a.m., 12:00 noon, 2:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Using discriminant analysis and F tests, all three measures (P3 and both by MSLT) were found to distinguish the two groups for collapsed five-nap data, and all showed essentially parallel circadian time-of-day effects, with greatest sleepiness in the midafternoon. The MSLT, however, was somewhat more powerful for collapsed data. Both tests misclassified some subjects as belonging to the other group, with greater misclassification for both tests in the control group and more overall for the P3 measure. Adding the two sleep onset REM period (SOREMP) criteria on MSLT for narcolepsy, one patient was still classified as normal. Analysis of data from individual naps indicated that the MSLT was considerably more powerful in discriminating groups than was P3 amplitude, and it did so for all five naps.",1988.0
2461281,Ambulatory 24 hour sleep-wake monitoring in narcolepsy-cataplexy compared to matched controls.,Broughton R; Dunham W; Newman J; Lutley K; Duschesne P; Rivers M,1988 Dec,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,"Twenty-four hour ambulatory sleep-wake recordings were made in 10 untreated patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 10 matched controls. Nocturnal sleep of narcoleptics was similar to descriptions of laboratory based recordings and was characterized by frequent sleep onset REM periods, high variability of REM latency, increased amounts of wakefulness after sleep onset, and low sleep efficiencies. Daytime portions in narcoleptics showed greater drowsiness and sleep than in controls with significantly higher amounts of stages 1A, 1B, 3, 4 and REM, more sleep episodes longer than 1 and longer than 10 min in duration, and high intersubject variability. On average, only 1.2 daytime sleep episodes began with sleep onset REM periods. There was a strong tendency in both groups towards a long mid-afternoon sleep episode often containing slow wave sleep (SWS) and which was significantly longer in narcoleptics. The mean interval between the onset of nocturnal SWS and the main daytime SWS peak was 14.1 h for narcoleptics and 13.6 h for controls. Daytime waking portions in narcoleptics showed significantly less 'active wakefulness' than in controls. There was no correlation between MSLT measures of sleepiness and amount of daytime sleep in ambulant recordings.",1988.0
2441964,"Differences between REM and NREM sleepiness measured by event-related potentials (P300, CNV), MSLT and subjective estimate in narcolepsy-cataplexy.",Broughton RJ; Aguirre M,1987 Oct,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,"Differences between 'REM sleepiness' and 'NREM sleepiness' states in wakefulness studied respectively prior to REM-containing and NREM-only multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) naps were compared by complex evoked potentials (P300, CNV), subjective estimate (Stanford Sleepiness Scale, SSS) and MSLT measures in 12 untreated patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy. The EP paradigms lasted about 7 min each and were done during the 10 min immediately before MSLT naps at 10.00, 12.00, 14.00, 16.00 and 18.00 h. SSS forms were completed immediately before and after the EP studies and MSLT naps. Patients were studied on 2 days and performed either the P300 or CNV paradigm on each day. 'REM sleepiness' was found to be subjectively and objectively (shorter mean sleep latency on MSLT) greater. Although subjects were sleepier in REM sleepiness, the subsequent REM nap was relatively more refreshing and reduced SSS estimates to levels equivalent to those after NREM-only naps. EP measures also showed differences between the 2 sleepiness states. REM sleepiness was associated with a significantly larger P2 component (in both the P300 paradigm and the CNV paradigm), a strong but not significant trend towards reduced amplitude of the P3 component, and almost total suppression of the slow negative components of the CNV. REM sleepiness and NREM sleepiness therefore appear to be district and differentiable cerebral states.",1987.0
2441963,Complex event-related potentials (P300 and CNV) and MSLT in the assessment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy-cataplexy.,Aguirre M; Broughton RJ,1987 Oct,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,"The P300 and contingent negative variation (CNV) evoked potential (EP) paradigms were performed by 12 untreated narcoleptics and controls immediately prior to each nap of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) in order to assess whether they might hold promise as rapid quantitative techniques to assess excessive daytime sleepiness. The Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) was also completed across test days and immediately before and after both the evoked potential recordings and MSLT naps. MSLT findings confirmed shorter sleep latencies and frequent SOREMPs in narcoleptics and a strong mid-afternoon increase in sleepiness based upon pressure for NREM sleep in both groups. On SSS narcoleptics were sleepier and they showed greater increase in sleepiness induced by the EP tests and greater sleepiness reduction by the MSLT naps. In the P300 paradigm, narcoleptics showed smaller component P3 amplitudes and larger P1 amplitudes. In the CNV paradigm, N1 latencies were greater in narcoleptics to both S1 and S2 and the post-CNV negative component was larger: but no significant differences were seen for the main CNV measures of negativity amplitude in the first or second halves of the response. The P300 paradigm but not the CNV, therefore, appeared to be a sensitive EP measure of sleepiness. Finally, EP components in both the P300 and CNV paradigms showed time-of-day (circadian) differences between narcoleptics and controls.",1987.0
3704444,Excessive daytime sleepiness and the pathophysiology of narcolepsy-cataplexy: a laboratory perspective.,Broughton R; Valley V; Aguirre M; Roberts J; Suwalski W; Dunham W,1986,Sleep,"The main disabling symptom of narcolepsy-cataplexy is shown to be the unrelenting excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) based upon controlled studies of socioeconomic effects and the poor response to treatment. Objective performance deficits mainly involve tests of ability to sustain performance on repetitive boring tasks and are reversible by improved alertness. Physiologically, EDS is seen to represent relatively slow waxing and waning of alertness rather than punctate microsleeps. Evidence is provided for complex cerebral evoked potentials (P300, contingent negative variation) being very sensitive EDS measures comparable to the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). EDS appears to have qualitatively somewhat different forms mainly reflecting pressure for REM sleep (REM sleepiness) or pressure for NREM sleep (NREM sleepiness), which have different effects on cerebral evoked potentials as well as subjective and objective (MSLT) differences. It is argued that in pathophysiological terms narcolepsy may best be considered a disease of state boundary control.",1986.0
3704442,Alerting effects of naps in patients with narcolepsy.,Roehrs T; Zorick F; Wittig R; Paxton C; Sicklesteel J; Roth T,1986,Sleep,"As part of their standard diagnostic evaluation, 45 patients with narcolepsy and 45 patients with other disorders of excessive sleepiness (DOES), primarily obstructive sleep apnea, each underwent one of three nap conditions that involved manipulating time in bed on the 1600 h latency test of the standard multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and varying the time between the 1600-h latency test and a subsequent fifth latency test. Compared with the mean of tests 1-4, a 15-min nap at 1600 h (condition 1) increased latency to stage 1 sleep on a latency test 15 min later in both groups. However, the increase was greater for patients with narcolepsy than with other DOES. A 30-min nap at 1600 h (condition 2) produced increased latency 15 min later, but the increase was greater for patients with other DOES. While narcoleptic patients showed no change in latency as a function of increased nap duration, the other DOES patients had increased latencies. When tested 30 min after a 15-min nap (condition 3), narcoleptic patients had latencies that did not differ from those of tests 1-4, while the other DOES patients sustained their increased latencies.",1986.0
3704441,Sleep-wake abnormalities in narcolepsy.,Zorick F; Roehrs T; Wittig R; Lamphere J; Sicklesteel J; Roth T,1986,Sleep,"To evaluate the degree to which sleep (REM vs. NREM) intrudes into wake and wake intrudes into sleep in narcolepsy, 103 patients with narcolepsy were compared to 105 patients with other diagnoses of disorders of excessive sleep (DOES). Narcoleptic patients had more frequent REM onsets on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and nocturnal polysomnograms. But the MSLT latencies to REM versus NREM in narcoleptic patients did not differ. Nocturnal measures of REM pressure, percentage of REM, and REM latency excluding the REM onsets, did not differ among patient groups. With respect to the intrusion of wake into sleep, narcoleptic patients had more and longer awakenings compared with other DOES patients, but the distribution of wake into REM and NREM sleep did not differ among groups. These data suggest that narcolepsy is not exclusively a REM-related disorder, but involves an inability to sustain a specific neural state for periods comparable to those in normal subjects or other DOES patients.",1986.0
3704440,Forty-eight-hour polysomnographic evaluation of narcolepsy.,Browman CP; Gujavarty KS; Yolles SF; Mitler MM,1986,Sleep,"Eleven narcoleptic and 11 control subjects completed five multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) procedures with instructions to ""fall asleep"" while supine and five maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) procedures with instructions to ""remain awake"" while comfortably sitting. Narcoleptic subjects had a shorter sleep latency and a higher frequency of sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) on both daytime tests than controls. Each group had a longer sleep latency on the MWT than MSLT. For patients with narcolepsy, the differences between the two daytime procedures suggest the tests measure distinct aspects of sleep-wake tendency. Sleep latency on the MSLT did not correlate with sleep latency on the MWT for narcoleptic subjects. Furthermore, the number of SOREMPs during the MSLT for narcoleptic subjects did not correlate with the number of SOREMP during the MWT. Measures of nocturnal REM sleep for narcoleptic subjects correlated with sleep latency on the MSLT. In particular, REM latency at night was highly predictive of the magnitude of hypersomnia for patients with narcolepsy. Sleep latency at night tended to relate to sleep latency on the daytime tests for controls. Patients with narcolepsy had a shorter sleep latency, more frequent arousals, and a shorter REM latency than control subjects across the 2 nights of study.",1986.0
3880172,Diagnosis of narcolepsy using the multiple sleep latency test: analysis of current laboratory criteria.,Amira SA; Johnson TS; Logowitz NB,1985 Dec,Sleep,"Multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) performed on 144 patients with excessive daytime somnolence were examined for the diagnostic reliability of a short sleep latency (SL less than 5 min) and the presence of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Based on clinical criteria, 61 patients (42%) were diagnosed as having narcolepsy. Thirty-five narcoleptic patients and five nonnarcoleptic patients exhibited a mean SL less than 5 min, yielding a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 94% for this criterion for pathological drowsiness. The occurrence of two or more SOREMPs was found in 52 narcoleptic patients but in only one nonnarcoleptic patient (sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 99%). Those narcoleptic patients with cataplexy demonstrated a shorter SL and more frequent SOREMPs than their noncataplectic counterparts. It was concluded that the MSLT is a highly reliable laboratory tool for the confirmation of the diagnosis of narcolepsy based on the SOREMP criterion. The criterion value for SL in pathological drowsiness may depend on laboratory conditions as well as the patient population selected.",1985.0
6581275,Multiple Sleep Latency Test findings in Kleine-Levin syndrome.,Reynolds CF; Kupfer DJ; Christiansen CL; Auchenbach RC; Brenner RP; Sewitch DE; Taska LS; Coble PA,1984 Jan,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,"Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) findings in a case of Kleine-Levin syndrome are reported for the first time. MSLT data indicate sleepiness as severe as in narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea and the occurrence of four sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods, with a greater REM propensity at 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. than at 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon. The replication of such findings might suggest that Kleine-Levin syndrome could be considered a form of periodic REM sleep disinhibition. Therefore, the traditional hypothesis of diencephalic dysfunction may require modification to include the role of more caudal brain stem structures specifically activated during REM sleep.",1984.0
7232969,Disorders of excessive daytime somnolence: polygraphic and clinical data for 100 patients.,van den Hoed J; Kraemer H; Guilleminault C; Zarcone VP Jr; Miles LE; Dement WC; Mitler MM,1981,Sleep,"A consecutive series of 100 sleep apnea free patients with the complaint of excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) were evaluated; data from medical histories, physical examination, personality inventories, and polysomnography [nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and daytime multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT)] were tabulated. Significant differences were found between narcoleptic and non-narcoleptic patients in a number of parameters, including EDS severity, mean sleep latency on MSLT, sleep latency on NPSG, latency to REM sleep at night, number of REM sleep at night, number of REM sleep segments throughout the night, the total number of nocturnal myoclonic jerks (as well as the number occurring per hour of NREM and REM sleep), and the number of arousals and wake periods preceded by a myoclonic jerk. Significant differences in sleep latency during MSLT and NPSG testing were found between different EDS diagnostic groups of non-narcoleptic patients. The majority of patients in the MSLT group with long sleep latencies were in the diagnostic groups of EDS associated with psychophysiological and/or psychiatric problems or with drug abuse; patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic central nervous system hypersomnia or EDS associated with disturbed nocturnal sleep formed the majority of the MSLT group with short sleep latencies. The non-narcoleptic patients in a MSLT group with short sleep latencies had significantly shorter sleep latencies at night, more sleep cycles, higher sleep efficiency, and earlier REM sleep than patients with long sleep latencies.",1981.0
