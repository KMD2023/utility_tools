Most sleep laboratories use polygraphic testing to establish the diagnosis. One polygraphic recording followed by a single multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is used to differentiate the causes of syndromes with complaints of daytime somnolence. Prospective investigations have demonstrated that patients with periodic leg movements or upper airway resistance syndrome may present abnormal sleep latencies and more than one sleep onset rapid eye movement period (SOREMP) during MSLT.

None of the following clinical variables, age, disease duration, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, smoking habit and BMI at the time of blood sampling, were associated with IgG levels in narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia. Furthermore we found the decrease in IgG1 and IgG2 levels, stable expression of IgG3, and the increase in the proportion of IgG4 in narcolepsy patients with abnormally low IgG levels. The increase in the proportion of IgG4 levels was also found in narcolepsy patients with normal serum total IgG levels.

We investigated serum IgG levels in narcolepsy.\n\nWe measured the serum total IgG levels in 159 Japanese narcolepsy-cataplexy patients positive for the HLA-DQB1*0602 allele, 28 idiopathic hypersomnia patients with long sleep time, and 123 healthy controls (the HLA-DQB1*0602 allele present in 45 subjects). The serum levels of each IgG subclass were subsequently measured. The distribution of serum IgG was significantly different among healthy controls negative for the HLA-DQB1*0602 allele (11.66+/-3.55 mg/ml), healthy controls positive for the HLA-DQB1*0602 allele (11.45+/-3.43), narcolepsy patients (9.67+/-3.38), and idiopathic hypersomnia patients (13.81+/-3.80). None of the following clinical variables, age, disease duration, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, smoking habit and BMI at the time of blood sampling, were associated with IgG levels in narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia. Furthermore we found the decrease in IgG1 and IgG2 levels, stable expression of IgG3, and the increase in the proportion of IgG4 in narcolepsy patients with abnormally low IgG levels. The increase in the proportion of IgG4 levels was also found in narcolepsy patients with normal serum total IgG levels.

Following the finding in Japan that almost all patients with narcolepsy carry a specific HLA subtype, HLA-DR2, Hugh Mac Devitt, F. Carl Grumet, and Larry Steinman initiated immunological studies, but results were generally negative. Using the narcoleptic canines, Dr. Nishino and I established that stimulants increased wakefulness by stimulating dopaminergic transmission while antidepressants suppress cataplexy via adrenergic reuptake inhibition.

The main clinical features of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep (cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations) are currently treated using amphetamine-like compounds or modafinil and antidepressants. Pharmacological research in the area is facilitated greatly by the existence of a canine model of the disorder. The mode of action of these compounds involves presynaptic activation of adrenergic transmission for the anticataplectic effects of antidepressant compounds and presynaptic activation of dopaminergic transmission for the EEG arousal effects of amphetamine-like stimulants. The mode of action of modafmil is still uncertain, and other neurochemical systems may offer interesting avenues for therapeutic development. Pharmacological and physiological studies using the canine model have identified primary neurochemical and neuroanatomical systems that underlie the expression of abnormal REM sleep and excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy.

The main clinical features of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep (cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations) are currently treated using amphetamine-like compounds or modafinil and antidepressants. Pharmacological research in the area is facilitated greatly by the existence of a canine model of the disorder. The mode of action of these compounds involves presynaptic activation of adrenergic transmission for the anticataplectic effects of antidepressant compounds and presynaptic activation of dopaminergic transmission for the EEG arousal effects of amphetamine-like stimulants. The mode of action of modafmil is still uncertain, and other neurochemical systems may offer interesting avenues for therapeutic development. Pharmacological and physiological studies using the canine model have identified primary neurochemical and neuroanatomical systems that underlie the expression of abnormal REM sleep and excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy. These involve mostly the pontine and basal forebrain cholinergic, the pontine adrenergic and the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic systems.

It is thus of crucial importance to define typical versus atypical cataplectic attacks, and a list of clinical features and related degrees of certainty is proposed in this paper (expert opinion). The time frame of at least three months of evolution of sleepiness to diagnose NT1 was removed in the ICSD-3-TR, when clear-cut cataplexy or orexin-deficiency are established. However, it was kept for NT2 diagnosis, a less well-characterized disorder with unknown clinical course and absence of biolo biomarkers; sleep deprivation, shift working and substances intake being major differential diagnoses. Treatment of narcolepsy is nowadays only symptomatic, but the upcoming arrival of non-peptide orexin receptor-2 agonists should be a revolution in the management of these rare sleep diseases.\u003c/div\u003e", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37634997/"}, {"abstract": "We report on the outcome of intravenous high-dose immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in four children with narcolepsy and cataplexy, in whom the early diagnosis and the extreme disease severity were indications for this potentially efficacious therapy.

Several brain regions involved in the central regulation of autonomic and endocrine processes or attention are targets of extensive hypocretin projections. The most dense arborization of hypocretin axons in the brainstem was detected in the locus coeruleus (LC). Multiple labeling immunocytochemistry revealed a massive synaptic innervation of catecholaminergic LC cells by hypocretin axon terminals in rats and monkeys. In both species, all tyrosine hydroxylase-immunopositive cells in the LC examined by electron microscopy were found to receive asymmetrical (excitatory) synaptic contacts from multiple axons containing hypocretin. In parallel electrophysiological studies with slices of rat brain, all LC cells showed excitatory responses to the hypocretin-2 peptide. Hypocretin-2 uniformly increased the frequency of action potentials in these cells, even in the presence of tetrodotoxin, indicating that receptors responding to hypocretin were expressed in LC neurons. Two mechanisms for the increased firing rate appeared to be a reduction in the slow component of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and a modest depolarization. Catecholamine systems in other parts of the brain, including those found in the medulla, zona incerta, substantia nigra or olfactory bulb, received significantly less hypocretin input. Comparative analysis of lateral hypothalamic input to the LC revealed that hypocretin-containing axon terminals were substantially more abundant than those containing melanin-concentrating hormone.

Several brain regions involved in the central regulation of autonomic and endocrine processes or attention are targets of extensive hypocretin projections. The most dense arborization of hypocretin axons in the brainstem was detected in the locus coeruleus (LC). Multiple labeling immunocytochemistry revealed a massive synaptic innervation of catecholaminergic LC cells by hypocretin axon terminals in rats and monkeys. In both species, all tyrosine hydroxylase-immunopositive cells in the LC examined by electron microscopy were found to receive asymmetrical (excitatory) synaptic contacts from multiple axons containing hypocretin. In parallel electrophysiological studies with slices of rat brain, all LC cells showed excitatory responses to the hypocretin-2 peptide. Hypocretin-2 uniformly increased the frequency of action potentials in these cells, even in the presence of tetrodotoxin, indicating that receptors responding to hypocretin were expressed in LC neurons. Two mechanisms for the increased firing rate appeared to be a reduction in the slow component of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and a modest depolarization. Catecholamine systems in other parts of the brain, including those found in the medulla, zona incerta, substantia nigra or olfactory bulb, received significantly less hypocretin input. Comparative analysis of lateral hypothalamic input to the LC revealed that hypocretin-containing axon terminals were substantially more abundant than those containing melanin-concentrating hormone. The present results provide evidence for direct action of hypothalamic hypocretin cells on the LC noradrenergic system in rats and monkeys. Our observations suggest a signaling pathway via which signals acting on the lateral hypothalamus may influence the activity of the LC and thereby a variety of CNSfunctions related to noradrenergic innervation, including vigilance, attention, learning, and memory.

In order to examine how hypocretin activity fluctuates across 24 h with respect to the sleep-wake cycle, we measured changes in extracellular hypocretin-1 levels in the lateral hypothalamus and medial thalamus of freely moving rats with simultaneous sleep recordings. Hypocretin levels exhibited a robust diurnal fluctuation; levels slowly increased during the dark period (active phase), and decreased during the light period (rest phase). Levels were not correlated with the amount of wake or sleep in each period.

In 1983, a Japanese study found that all patients carried HLA-DR2, suggesting autoimmunity as the cause of the disease. Studies in the canine model established that dopaminergic stimulation underlies anti-narcoleptic action of psychostimulants, while antidepressants were found to suppress cataplexy through adrenergic reuptake inhibition. No HLA association was found in canines. A linkage study initiated in 1988 revealed in hypocretin (orexin) receptor two mutations as the cause of canine narcolepsy in 1999. In 1992, studies on African Americans showed that DQ0602 was a better marker than DR2 across all ethnic groups. In 2000, hypocretin-1/orexin\u2009A levels were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and found to be undetectable in most patients, establishing hypocretin deficiency as the cause of narcolepsy. Decreased CSF hypocretin-1 was then found to be secondary to the loss of the 70,000\u2009neurons producing hypocretin in the hypothalamus, suggesting immune destruction of these cells as the cause of the disease. Additional genetic studies, notably genome wide associations (GWAS), found multiple genetic predisposing factors for narcolepsy. These were almost all involved in other autoimmune diseases, although a strong and unique association with T\u2009cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta loci were observed. Nonetheless, all attempts to demonstrate presence of autoantibodies against hypocretin cells in narcolepsy failed, and the presumed autoimmune cause remained unproven.

It is chronic in nature and negatively impacts the quality of life of affected patients. The classic presentation is a tetrad of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. The exact cause remains unknown, but there is significant evidence that hypocretin deficiency plays an integral role. Some primary conditions that result in secondary narcolepsy include traumatic brain injury, congenital disorders, tumours, and strokes. Some medical and psychiatric disorders share characteristics of narcolepsy, at times leading to diagnostic inaccuracy. Other sleep disorders are commonly co-morbid. Diagnosis relies on patient history and objective data gathered from polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing.

It is chronic in nature and negatively impacts the quality of life of affected patients. The classic presentation is a tetrad of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. The exact cause remains unknown, but there is significant evidence that hypocretin deficiency plays an integral role. Some primary conditions that result in secondary narcolepsy include traumatic brain injury, congenital disorders, tumours, and strokes. Some medical and psychiatric disorders share characteristics of narcolepsy, at times leading to diagnostic inaccuracy. Other sleep disorders are commonly co-morbid. Diagnosis relies on patient history and objective data gathered from polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. Treatment focuses on symptom relief through medication, education, and behavioural modification. Both classic pharmacological treatments as well as newer options have significant problems, especially because of side effects and abuse potential.

Narcolepsy is caused by hypocretin (orexin) deficiency, paralleled by a dramatic loss in hypothalamic hypocretin-producing neurons. It is believed that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder, although definitive proof of this, such as the presence of autoantibodies, is still lacking. We engineered a transgenic mouse model to identify peptides enriched within hypocretin-producing neurons that could serve as potential autoimmune targets. Initial analysis indicated that the transcript encoding Tribbles homolog 2 (Trib2), previously identified as an autoantigen in autoimmune uveitis, was enriched in hypocretin neurons in these mice. ELISA analysis showed that sera from narcolepsy patients with cataplexy had higher Trib2-specific antibody titers compared with either normal controls or patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, multiple sclerosis, or other inflammatory neurological disorders.

Narcolepsy is caused by hypocretin (orexin) deficiency, paralleled by a dramatic loss in hypothalamic hypocretin-producing neurons. It is believed that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder, although definitive proof of this, such as the presence of autoantibodies, is still lacking. We engineered a transgenic mouse model to identify peptides enriched within hypocretin-producing neurons that could serve as potential autoimmune targets. Initial analysis indicated that the transcript encoding Tribbles homolog 2 (Trib2), previously identified as an autoantigen in autoimmune uveitis, was enriched in hypocretin neurons in these mice. ELISA analysis showed that sera from narcolepsy patients with cataplexy had higher Trib2-specific antibody titers compared with either normal controls or patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, multiple sclerosis, or other inflammatory neurological disorders. Trib2-specific antibody titers were highest early after narcolepsy onset, sharply decreased within 2-3 years, and then stabilized at levels substantially higher than that of controls for up to 30 years. High Trib2-specific antibody titers correlated with the severity of cataplexy. Serum of a patient showed specific immunoreactivity with over 86% of hypocretin neurons in the mouse hypothalamus.

The brain circuitry governing REM sleep is located in the pontine and medullary brainstem and includes ascending and descending projections that regulate the EEG and motor components of REM sleep.

Sleep stage composition has not been seen as influencing subsequent daytime functioning; however, earlier studies did not focus explicitly on sleepiness. The present experiment studied the effects of selective sleep-stage restriction on an objective measure of sleep tendency, and explored the relationship between sleepiness and subsequent REM recurrence during REM deprivation. Daytime sleep latency was measured by a modified Multiple Sleep Latency Test prior to and following two nights of awakenings from either REM or Stage 2 sleep in 16 normal young adults. Sleep latency following these awakenings was also measured. REM sleep and Stage 2 awakenings produced comparable levels of sleepiness, both during the Awakening Nights and subsequent daytime Multiple Sleep Latency Testing. Pooling the groups, daytime and nocturnal sleepiness measures were correlated within individuals.

Sleep stage composition has not been seen as influencing subsequent daytime functioning; however, earlier studies did not focus explicitly on sleepiness. The present experiment studied the effects of selective sleep-stage restriction on an objective measure of sleep tendency, and explored the relationship between sleepiness and subsequent REM recurrence during REM deprivation. Daytime sleep latency was measured by a modified Multiple Sleep Latency Test prior to and following two nights of awakenings from either REM or Stage 2 sleep in 16 normal young adults. Sleep latency following these awakenings was also measured. REM sleep and Stage 2 awakenings produced comparable levels of sleepiness, both during the Awakening Nights and subsequent daytime Multiple Sleep Latency Testing. Pooling the groups, daytime and nocturnal sleepiness measures were correlated within individuals. In the REM-Awakening Group, Pre-Awakening daytime sleepiness was associated with the tendency for REM sleep to recur following experimental awakenings. Comparable levels of sleepiness may result from nonspecific processes such as sleep curtailment and fragmentation, or alternatively from separate REM and Stage 2 mechanisms.

Features of narcolepsy include dysregulation of arousal state boundaries as well as autonomic and metabolic disturbances. Disruption of neurotransmission through the hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) system, usually by degeneration of the HCRT-producing neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, results in narcolepsy. The cause of Hcrt neurodegeneration is unknown but thought to be related to autoimmune processes. Current treatments for narcolepsy are symptomatic, including wake-promoting therapeutics that increase presynaptic dopamine release and anticataplectic agents that activate monoaminergic neurotransmission. Sodium oxybate is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that alleviates both sleep/wake disturbances and cataplexy. Development of therapeutics for narcolepsy has been challenged by historical misunderstanding of the disease, its many disparate symptoms and, until recently, its unknown etiology.

Features of narcolepsy include dysregulation of arousal state boundaries as well as autonomic and metabolic disturbances. Disruption of neurotransmission through the hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) system, usually by degeneration of the HCRT-producing neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, results in narcolepsy. The cause of Hcrt neurodegeneration is unknown but thought to be related to autoimmune processes. Current treatments for narcolepsy are symptomatic, including wake-promoting therapeutics that increase presynaptic dopamine release and anticataplectic agents that activate monoaminergic neurotransmission. Sodium oxybate is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that alleviates both sleep/wake disturbances and cataplexy. Development of therapeutics for narcolepsy has been challenged by historical misunderstanding of the disease, its many disparate symptoms and, until recently, its unknown etiology. Animal models have been essential to elucidating the neuropathology underlying narcolepsy. These models have also aided understanding the neurobiology of the Hcrt system, mechanisms of cataplexy, and the pharmacology of narcolepsy medications.

It is caused by the loss of ~70,000 posterior hypothalamic neurons that produce the wake-promoting neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT) (orexin). We identified two DQ0602-binding HCRT epitopes, HCRT56-68 and HCRT87-99, that activated a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells in narcolepsy patients but not in DQ0602-positive healthy control subjects. Because of the established association of narcolepsy with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A strain (pH1N1), we administered a seasonal influenza vaccine (containing pH1N1) to patients with narcolepsy and found an increased frequency of circulating HCRT56-68- and HCRT87-99-reactive T cells.

It is caused by the loss of ~70,000 posterior hypothalamic neurons that produce the wake-promoting neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT) (orexin). We identified two DQ0602-binding HCRT epitopes, HCRT56-68 and HCRT87-99, that activated a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells in narcolepsy patients but not in DQ0602-positive healthy control subjects. Because of the established association of narcolepsy with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A strain (pH1N1), we administered a seasonal influenza vaccine (containing pH1N1) to patients with narcolepsy and found an increased frequency of circulating HCRT56-68- and HCRT87-99-reactive T cells.

Patients were systematically interviewed evaluating narcoleptic and OSAS features and their response to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment when applied.\n\nOne hundred and thirty-three patients with narcolepsy.\n\nThirty-three patients (24.8%) had an apnea-hypopnea index greater than 10 with a mean index of 28.5+/-15.7. Ten of them were initially diagnosed only with OSAS and the diagnosis of narcolepsy was delayed 6.1+/-7.8years until being evaluated in our center for residual EDS after CPAP therapy. In the remaining 23 patients, narcolepsy and OSA were diagnosed simultaneously. Cataplexy occurred with similar frequency in both groups. EDS did not improve in 11 of the 14 patients who were treated with CPAP. The presence of OSA was associated with male gender, older age and higher body mass index.\n\nOSA occurs frequently in narcolepsy and may delay the diagnosis of narcolepsy by several years and interfere with its proper management. In patients with OSA, cataplexy should be actively looked for to exclude the presence of narcolepsy.

In this study, we investigated the reliability of using the correlation between orexin-A and A\u03b242 CSF levels as a candidate marker to explain the chain of events leading to narcolepsy or AD pathology. In order to test the correlation between these biomarkers, patients diagnosed with AD (n\u00a0=\u00a076), narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, n\u00a0=\u00a017), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2, n\u00a0=\u00a023) and healthy subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a091) were examined.

CSF levels of A\u03b242, total-tau, phosphorylated-tau, and orexin-A were assessed.

Moderate-severe AD patients (mini mental state examination\u00a0\u0026lt;\u00a021) showed the highest CSF orexin-A levels, whereas NT1 patients showed the lowest CSF orexin-A levels.

Recently, orexin and A\u03b2 cerebral dynamics have been studied in both pathologies, but how they interact with each other remains further to be known. In this study, we investigated the reliability of using the correlation between orexin-A and A\u03b242 CSF levels as a candidate marker to explain the chain of events leading to narcolepsy or AD pathology. In order to test the correlation between these biomarkers, patients diagnosed with AD (n\u00a0=\u00a076), narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, n\u00a0=\u00a017), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2, n\u00a0=\u00a023) and healthy subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a091) were examined. Patients and healthy subjects underwent lumbar puncture between 8:00 and 10:00 am at the Neurology Unit of the University Hospital of Rome \u0026quot;Tor Vergata\u0026quot;. CSF levels of A\u03b242, total-tau, phosphorylated-tau, and orexin-A were assessed. The results showed that CSF levels of A\u03b242 were significantly lower (p\u00a0\u0026lt;\u00a00.001) in AD (332.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0237.36\u00a0pg/mL) compared to NT1 (569.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0187.00\u00a0pg/mL), NT2 (691.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0292.63\u00a0pg/mL) and healthy subjects (943.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0198.12\u00a0pg/mL).

Improved diagnostic tools and increased understanding of the pathogenesis of narcolepsy type 1 are needed and might lead to therapeutic or even preventative interventions.\u003c/div\u003e", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28179647/"}, {"abstract": "", "color": "#2ca02c", "id": "32253429", "label": "32253429", "shape": "dot", "size": 15, "title": "\u003cb\u003ePMID:\u003c/b\u003e 32253429\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eYear:\u003c/b\u003e 2020\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eTitle:\u003c/b\u003e Defining disrupted nighttime sleep and assessing its diagnostic utility for pediatric narcolepsy type 1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eJournal:\u003c/b\u003e Sleep\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\u0027max-height:150px; overflow:auto; border:1px solid #ccc; padding:4px; background:#f9f9f9;\u0027\u003e\u003cb\u003eAbstract:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32253429/"}, {"abstract": "", "color": {"background": "#1f77b4", "border": "#d62728", "highlight": {"background": "#1f77b4", "border": "#d62728"}, "hover": {"background": "#1f77b4", "border": "#d62728"}}, "id": "4369176", "label": "4369176", "shape": "dot", "size": 30, "title": "\u003cb\u003ePMID:\u003c/b\u003e 4369176\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eYear:\u003c/b\u003e 1974\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eTitle:\u003c/b\u003e Sleep disorders.
