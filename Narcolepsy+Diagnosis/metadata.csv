There is often a delay to diagnosis of narcolepsy, mainly due to the lack of recognition of this disorder. One of the main factors hindering the diagnosis of narcolepsy is the association of comorbidities, which include other sleep disorders, psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and metabolic disorders. The signs and symptoms of these comorbidities often overlap with those of narcolepsy, and some of the medications used for their treatment may obscure the symptoms of narcolepsy, leading to a delay in diagnosis. This review is targeted to clinicians unaccustomed to working with sleep disorders and aims to increase recognition and improve the management of narcolepsy.",2022.0

Patients of all ages with a diagnosis of narcolepsy registered in the National Patient Registry in specialist care in Sweden were included and information on treatments for narcolepsy was retrieved from The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register.

We collected 2508 patients with narcolepsy, 43,3% men and 56,7% women and 47,9% were prescribed modafenil, 33,8% metylphenidate and 26,2% amphetamine. In total, 3817 treatments were initiated. Patients treated with amphetamine had a higher mean age. More women than men used modafinil, methylphenidate, amphetamine and antidepressants. The narcolepsy population had more outpatient than inpatient healthcare. Patients treated with sodium oxybate had more outpatient visits than other narcolepsy patients, before and during treatment (p = .00).

This study gives valuable information on pharmaceutical treatments and healthcare utilization for patients with narcolepsy and can be used to estimate the healthcare cost in the future. Patients with sodium oxybate treatment had more outpatient visits than other patients before and during treatment which may be due to the need to monitor potentially severe side-effects or may indicate that patients with sodium oxybate treatment have a severe disease. The number of included patients was less than expected; however, this may depend on patients escaping our collection of data, which does not contain information from primary care.",2022.0

Clinical manifestations may be nonspecific; on the basis of objective measures it is possible to determine the current severity of sleepiness, but they do not always allow accurate diagnosis. It is especially difficult to distinguish between idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) and hypersomnia associated with a psychiatric disorder (PSY).

To find significant differences between the IH and PSY groups, we included 67 patients (IH, n = 15; PSY, n = 52) in the study, focusing on differences in self-reported symptoms, evaluating current depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory-II score and personality traits measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory. All of the patients underwent polysomnography, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and ad libitum sleep monitoring.

The patients with IH showed greater difficulty than those in the PSY group with waking up in the morning (P < .001) and complained of memory (P = .04) and attention deficit (P = .006). They also showed higher total sleep time (P < .001) and sleep efficiency (P = .007) and a shorter mean sleep latency on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (P < .001). Nevertheless, the IH and PSY groups did not differ in Beck Depression Inventory scores or personality characteristics.

IH is a syndrome in which depression/external life stressors and personality characteristics also play a role. Patients with IH may benefit from the cooperation of sleep specialists with psychotherapists/psychiatrists.

The Nexus Narcolepsy Registry (NCT02769780) is a longitudinal, web-based patient registry of self-reported data from adults with physician-diagnosed narcolepsy. Surveys were electronically distributed every 6 months; the current analysis reports registry population demographics, narcolepsy diagnosis journey, and predictors of diagnostic delays.

The registry population included in this analysis (N = 1024) was predominantly female (85%) and White (92%), with a mean age of 37.7 years. Most participants had education/training beyond high school (93%). Mean (median) reported ages at narcolepsy symptom onset, first consultation for symptoms, and narcolepsy diagnosis were 18.1 (16), 26.4 (24), and 30.1 (28) years, respectively. A majority (59%) of participants reported ≥1 misdiagnosis, and 29% reported consulting ≥5 physicians before narcolepsy diagnosis. More than half (56%) of participants' first consultations for narcolepsy symptoms were with a general practitioner, whereas the diagnosing clinician was usually a sleep specialist (64%) or neurologist (27%). Pediatric symptom onset was associated with a longer mean interval to first consultation than adult symptom onset (10.7 and 4.6 years, respectively; P < 0.001) and a longer mean interval between first consultation and diagnosis (4.5 and 2.2 years, respectively; P < 0.001). Overall, mean (95% CI) time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 11.8 (11.1-12.5) years.

In narcolepsy, daytime sleepiness is the main symptom but some studies indicate fatigue being present. We aimed to assess fatigue and associated features in patients with MS or narcolepsy and healthy controls and to assess whether clinical parameters separate fatigued (MS-F) and non-fatigued MS patients (MS-NoF).

In this non-interventional cross-sectional study, we recruited 34 MS patients, 15 narcolepsy type 1 patients and 17 healthy controls. An interviewer administered the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Saltin-Grimby Physical Activity Level Scale. Information about clinical parameters and current treatments was collected.

In its fatigue profile, MS-F resembled the narcolepsy group rather than MS-NoF, which resembled the healthy control group. ISI alone was significantly associated with FSS, and only in MS-NoF and healthy controls; in MS-F and the narcolepsy group, no variable was associated with FSS. Months since diagnosis was the only clinical variable significantly separating MS-F from MS-NoF. In MS, disease duration correlated with fatigue. No clinical variables correlated with fatigue in the narcolepsy group.

Fatigued MS patients resemble narcolepsy patients more than they resemble non-fatigued MS patients, who resemble healthy controls. Insomnia is the main factor associated with fatigue in MS, while disease duration is the only clinical variable separating fatigued and non-fatigued MS patients. In fatigued patients, variance in fatigue cannot be explained by insomnia, daytime sleepiness, depression or level of exercise.",2021.0

Actitigraphy may support efforts to distinguish them. We aimed to evaluate: 1) the ability of actigraphy to quantify sleep continuity measures in comparison with polysomnography in patients with hypersomnolence; 2) whether actigraphy can distinguish patients with hypersomnolence with normal hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with narcolepsy type 1 and from sleep-healthy controls; and 3) the distinct activity profiles and circadian rhythms of patients with narcolepsy type 1, patients with hypersomnolence with normal hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid, and sleep-healthy controls.

Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency tests and actigraphy were conducted in 14 patients with narcolepsy type 1, 29 patients with hypersomnolence with normal hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid and 15 sleep-healthy controls.

Actigraphy quantified several sleep continuity measures consistently with polysomnography in all the patients. Actigraphy distinguished patients with hypersomnolence with normal hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with narcolepsy type 1 and sleep-healthy controls. Patients with narcolepsy type 1 had poor sleep quality and altered circadian rest-activity rhythm compared with controls.

Secondary narcolepsy can occur as a result of other conditions affecting the central nervous system, including limbic paraneoplastic encephalitis. We report the case of a 19-year-old patient presenting with acute-onset diurnal hypersomnolence, hyperphagia, sexual dysfunction, and psychiatric disturbances. Further investigations revealed a limbic paraneoplastic encephalitis associated with mediastinal thymic seminoma. Tumor removal and immunosuppressive treatment resulted in a partial benefit on psychiatric disturbances but did not improve daytime sleepiness. A comprehensive sleep assessment led to the diagnosis of secondary narcolepsy type 1 with reduced cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and revealed the presence of the HLA DQB1*0602 allele, typically associated with idiopathic narcolepsy, for which we hypothesize a possible immunopathogenic role. Sodium oxybate was successfully administered. Narcolepsy is often overlooked in patients with limbic paraneoplastic encephalitis. A prompt assessment and an adequate symptomatic treatment can improve the disease burden.

It is categorized into two subtypes-type 1 (N1) and type 2 (N2). Symptoms of N1 commonly include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and disturbed nighttime sleep. Ethnic differences have been observed, but they have not been reported in an Ethiopian patient to date.

We report a 39-year-old Ethiopian patient with type 1 narcolepsy whose diagnosis was delayed for three decades despite severe symptoms. Her quality of life was significantly impaired and included EDS, sleep fragmentation, and depression. The mean sleep latency (MSL) for five naps was 1.3 minutes. Sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) were present in all five nap periods. HLA-typing and a CSF hypocretin level testing were not performed. Modafinil 300mg was prescribed, which improved her quality of life.

Recent findings suggest that sleep-wakefulness dysfunctions may predispose to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vice versa. New theories on the link between sleep and β-amyloid and tau secretion, accumulation and clearance, and its interaction with hypocretins/orexins (key neuropeptides regulating wakefulness) suggest mechanistic ways to better understand the impact of sleep alterations in the pathogenesis of AD. Further studies should validate whether changes in circadian rhythm and sleep-wakefulness patterns could be used for early AD diagnosis and as prognostic markers for cognitive decline.

It is now well recognized that the loss of hypocretin neurons underlies the pathogenesis of narcolepsy type I, however, the pathogenesis of narcolepsy type II is currently unknown. Both genetic and environmental factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. There is increasing evidence that autoimmune processes may play a critical role in the loss of hypocretin neurons. Infections especially streptococcus and influenza have been proposed as a potential trigger for the autoimmune-mediated mechanism. Several recent studies have shown increased cases of pediatric narcolepsy following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The increased cases in Europe seem to be related to a specific type of H1N1 influenza vaccination (Pandemrix), while the increased cases in China are related to influenza infection. Children with narcolepsy can have an unusual presentation at disease onset including complex motor movements which may lead to delayed diagnosis. All classic narcolepsy tetrads are present in only a small proportion of children. The diagnosis of narcolepsy is confirmed by either obtaining cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin or overnight sleep study with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). There are limitations of using MSLT in young children such that a negative MSLT test cannot exclude narcolepsy. HLA markers have limited utility in narcolepsy, but it may be useful in young children with clinical suspicion of narcolepsy. For management, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments are important in the management of narcolepsy. Pharmacotherapy is primarily aimed to address excessive daytime sleepiness and REM-related symptoms such as cataplexy. In addition to pharmacotherapy, routine screening of behavioral and psychosocial issues is warranted to identify patients who would benefit from bio-behavior intervention.",2022.0

In order to better understand worldwide trends in clinical assessment and management of narcolepsy, a survey of health-care providers was conducted by the World Sleep Society Narcolepsy task force.

A total of 146 surveys that included items on the diagnosis and management of narcolepsy were completed by practitioners representing 37 countries.

Most of the participants were from Europe, North America, Oceania, Asia and Latin America. A consistent approach to applying the diagnostic criteria of Narcolepsy was documented with the exception of measurement of CSF hypocretin-1, which has limited availability. While the majority of practitioners (58%) reported not using the test, 1% indicated always evaluating CSF hypocretin-1 levels. There was much variability in the availability of currently recommended medications such as sodium oxybate and pitolisant; modafinil and antidepressants were the most commonly used medications. Amphetamines were unavailable in some countries.

The results of the study highlight clinical and therapeutic realities confronted by worldwide physicians in the management of narcolepsy. While the diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy rely in part on the quantification of CSF hypocretin-1, few physicians reported having incorporated this test into their routine assessment of the condition.

We aimed to review the association between, and medical management of, narcolepsy and psychosis in children and adults.

We reviewed the full text of 100 papers from 187 identified by a PubMed search on narcolepsy plus any of these keywords: psychosis, schizophrenia, delusion, side effects, safety, and bipolar disorder.

Three relevant groups are described. (i) In typical narcolepsy, psychotic-like symptoms include predominantly visual hallucinations at the sleep-wake transition (experienced as ""not real"") and dissociation because of intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena into wakefulness. (ii) Atypical patients (""the psychotic form of narcolepsy"") experience more severe and vivid, apparently REM-related hallucinations or dream/reality confusions, which patients may rationalize in a delusion-like way. (iii) Some patients have a comorbid schizophrenia spectrum disorder with psychotic symptoms unrelated to sleep. Psychostimulants used to treat narcolepsy may trigger psychotic symptoms in all three groups. We analyzed 58 published cases from groups 2 and 3 (n = 17 and 41). Features that were reported significantly more frequently in atypical patients include visual and multimodal hallucinations, sexual and mystical delusions, and false memories. Dual diagnosis patients had more disorganized symptoms and earlier onset of narcolepsy.

Epidemiological studies tentatively suggest a possible association between narcolepsy and schizophrenia only for very early-onset cases, which could be related to the partially overlapping neurodevelopmental changes observed in these disorders. We propose a clinical algorithm for the management of cases with psychotic-like or psychotic features.",2021.0

We aimed to determine if microsleep data prior to sleep onset assisted in interpretation of ability to maintain wakefulness across a range of typical patient groups.

Forty-eight patients referred for overnight polysomnography and subsequent MWT were included. Patients were divided into 3 groups (treated obstructive sleep apnea [OSA], untreated OSA, or treated idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy) based on prior medical diagnosis. Demographics, clinical characteristics, polysomnography, and MWT variables, including frequency, distribution, duration, and latency of microsleeps were compared between groups.

Microsleeps were observed in MWT trials significantly more frequently in patients with treated idiopathic hypersomnia/narcolepsy over the course of the day (0.34 ± 0.06 vs 0.07 ± 0.02 microsleeps/min; P < .001) and in patients with untreated OSA toward the end of the day (0.31 ± 0.06 vs 0.05 ± 0.02 microsleeps/min; P < .001) compared to the group with treated OSA. Microsleeps were often observed in series and earlier in patients with treated idiopathic hypersomnia/narcolepsy (10.9 ± 1.6 minutes) and those with untreated OSA (16.2 ± 2.7 minutes) compared to the group with treated OSA (24.9 ± 3.0 minutes; P < .05), and, if taken into consideration, would increase the proportion of patients demonstrating inability to maintain wakefulness by 33% and 22%, respectively.

MWT performance varies significantly across patient groups. Microsleep analysis prior to sleep onset may be a more sensitive measure of patient daytime wakefulness than sleep latency alone and should be considered in MWT assessment.

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score showed a significant increase with age, while self-reported diurnal total sleep time was lower in older and young adults, with the latter also complaining of automatic behaviors in more than 90% of patients. Children reported the cataplexy attacks to be more frequent (> 1/d in 95% of patients). ""Recalling an emotional event,"" ""meeting someone unexpectedly,"" ""stress,"" and ""anger"" were more frequently reported in adult and older adult patients as possible triggers of cataplexy. Neurophysiological data showed a higher number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test in adolescent compared to senior patients and an age-progressive decline in sleep efficiency.

These rare disorders make the diagnosis complex, as multiple sleep disorders are known to cause false-positive results on testing. There is a high incidence of sleep disorders in the military, and the diagnosis of narcolepsy can have serious career implications. This study looked to assess for the presence of confounding disorders in patients previously diagnosed with narcolepsy.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients aged 18-65 previously diagnosed with narcolepsy at an outside facility, referred for repeat evaluation at the Wilford Hall Sleep Disorders Center. Previous test results from the time of original diagnosis were reviewed if available and compared with repeat evaluation which included actigraphy, in-laboratory polysomnography, and multiple sleep latency testing.

Of the 23 patients, 2 (9%) retained a diagnosis of narcolepsy after repeat testing. Ten patients (43%) had insufficient sleep syndrome, five (22%) had significant circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, and nine (39%) patients were diagnosed with mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Four of the nine patients with OSA (44%) had supine predominant OSA.

33594925,Dissociative Symptoms are Highly Prevalent in Adults with Narcolepsy Type 1.,Quaedackers L; Droogleever Fortuyn H; Van Gilst M; Lappenschaar M; Overeem S,2022 Jan-Feb,Behavioral sleep medicine,"The core symptoms of narcolepsy such as excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy are well known. However, there is mounting evidence for a much broader symptom spectrum, including psychiatric symptoms. Disordered sleep has previously been linked with dissociative symptoms, which may imply that patients with narcolepsy are more prone to develop such symptoms.

To investigate the frequency of dissociative symptoms in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 compared to population controls.

In a retrospective case control study, sixty adult patients fulfilling the criteria for narcolepsy type 1 and 120 matched population control subjects received a structured interview using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) to assess dissociative symptoms and disorders.

A majority of narcolepsy patients reported dissociative symptoms, and even fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria of a dissociative disorder (62% vs 1% in controls, p < .001). Most frequently reported symptoms were ""dissociative amnesia"" (37% vs 1%, p < .001) and ""dissociative disorder of voluntary movement"" (32% vs 1%, p < .001).

Dissociative symptoms are strikingly prevalent in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1. Although a formal diagnosis of dissociation disorder should not be made as the symptoms can be explained by narcolepsy as an underlying condition, the findings do illustrate the extent and severity of the dissociative symptoms. As for the pathophysiological mechanism, there may be symptom overlap between narcolepsy and dissociation disorder. However, there may also be a more direct link between disrupted sleep and dissociative symptoms. In either case, the high frequency of occurrence of dissociative symptoms should result in an active inquiry by doctors, to improve therapeutic management and guidance.",2022.0
33588261,Idiopathic hypersomnia: a homogeneous or heterogeneous disease?,Nevsimalova S; Susta M; Prihodova I; Horvat EM; Milata M; Sonka K,2021 Apr,Sleep medicine,"Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a rare orphan disease characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, frequently accompanied by prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulties awakening, termed sleep inertia or sleep drunkenness. Severe sleepiness usually causes a greater handicap than manifestations of narcolepsy.

Forty-three IH patients (17 male, mean age 42.8 ± SD 12.2 years, range 20-67), diagnosed in the past 20 years according to ICSD-2 or ICSD-3 criteria were invited for clinical examination to evaluate the course, manifestations and severity of the disease, as well as clinical comorbidities. The patients completed a set of questionnaires scoring sleepiness, sleep inertia, fatigue, depression, anxiety, circadian preference, and quality of life.

IH patients were divided according to the duration of nocturnal sleep at the time of their diagnosis into two cohorts: (1) with normal sleep duration (n = 25, 58.1%) and (2) with long sleep duration (n = 18, 41.9%). The mean duration of ad libitum sleep per 22 h in the second cohort was 732.0 ± 115.4 min (range 603-1100), and women markedly prevailed (n = 14, 77.8%). Age at disease onset was younger in the group with long sleep duration (21.2 ± 11.4 years versus 28.1 ± 13.6 years, p = 0.028), their MSLT latency was longer (7.2 ± 3.7 min versus 5.1 ± 1.7 min, p = 0.005), a history of sleep inertia prevailed (p = 0.005), and daily naps were mostly non-refreshing (p = 0.014). Additionally, questionnaires in the group with long sleep duration showed more severe sleep inertia (p = 0.007), fatigue (p = 0.004), and a tendency towards evening chronotype (p = 0.001).

IH patients with long sleep duration differ clinically as well as by objective measures at the time of diagnosis and in long-term follow up from IH patients without long 24-h sleep time. In our opinion they represent an independent clinical entity to be considered in the revised ICSD-3 criteria.",2021.0

In human narcolepsy type 1, this cycle is disrupted due to loss of orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin-A measurement is used in the diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1. Currently available immunoassays may lack specificity for accurate orexin quantification. We developed and validated a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay (LC-MS/MS) for CSF orexin-A and B.

We used CSF samples from narcolepsy type 1 (n = 22) and type 2 (n = 6) and non-narcoleptic controls (n = 44). Stable isotope-labeled orexin-A and -B internal standards were added to samples before solid-phase extraction and quantification by LC-MS/MS. The samples were also assayed by commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA, n = 42) and enzymatic immunoassay (EIA, n = 72) kits. Stability of orexins in CSF was studied for 12 months.

Our assay has a good sensitivity (10 pmol/L = 35 pg/mL) and a wide linear range (35-3500 pg/mL). Added orexin-A and -B were stable in CSF for 12 and 3 months, respectively, when frozen. The median orexin-A concentration in CSF from narcolepsy type 1 patients was <35 pg/mL (range < 35-131 pg/mL), which was lower than that in CSF from control individuals (98 pg/mL, range < 35-424 pg/mL). Orexin-A concentrations determined using our LC-MS/MS assay were five times lower than those measured with a commercial RIA. Orexin-B concentrations were undetectable.

Orexin-A concentrations measured by our LC-MS/MS assay were lower in narcolepsy type 1 patients as compared to controls. RIA yielded on average higher concentrations than LC-MS/MS.",2021.0

Despite the existenceof precise diagnostic criteria, this entity remains underdiagnosed. It is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness associated with cataplexy; in some cases, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, and/or delusional ideation may appear. The occurrence of psychotic symptoms makes differential diagnosis extremely difficult (narcolepsy, schizophrenia, or both). Furthermore, therapeutic management may be complex, since the treatment of one of the disorders may worsen the other.

This is a retrospective, consecutive study of adult and pediatric narcolepsy patients in the Republic of Ireland. All participants underwent structured assessments, including polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, hypocretin levels, and human leukocyte antigen typing were also carried out on the majority of patients. Patients were compared across age groups as well as etiology.

The conditions of 40 (74%) patients were vaccine-related. The median age was 13.5 years and time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 112 weeks. Median time from vaccination to symptom onset was 26 weeks. In children, hypnogogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis were less frequent than in adults (17% vs 67%, P = .018 and 0% vs 75%, P < .0005). Sleep latency determined by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test was shorter in children than adults (median 1.75 vs 4 minutes, P = .011). Patients with vaccine-related and sporadic narcolepsies had typical clinical presentations. Vaccine-related patients had longer polysomnography latency (median 10.5 vs 5 minutes, P = .043), longer stage N2 sleep (209.6 ± 44.6 vs 182.3 ± 34.2 minutes, P = .042), and a trend toward longer total sleep times (P = .09). No differences were noted in relation to Multiple Sleep Latency Test, hypocretin, human leukocyte antigen typing, and magnetic resonance imaging.

Results show that vaccine-related patients greatly outnumbered sporadic patients during the study period and suggest that sporadic and vaccine-related narcolepsy are clinically similar entities.",2021.0
33238081,Recognizing and Treating Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Patients With Narcolepsy.,Roth T; Winkelman JW,2020 Nov 24,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,"Sleep disorders such as narcolepsy can cause excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The diagnosis of narcolepsy is often delayed by years. Clinicians can improve the recognition of EDS and diagnosis of sleep disorders using screening tools such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and other tests. By following up with patients who present with EDS and continuing to assess until a cause is found, clinicians can lessen the time to diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment. Fortunately, existing pharmacologic interventions are effective in reducing EDS for many patients, but elimination of EDS for most patients has not been achieved. Some interventions also show efficacy in cataplexy. Nonpharmacologic strategies should also be discussed with patients. Clinicians must monitor EDS during ongoing treatment so that residual symptoms can be addressed. Research suggests a causative role for hypocretin deficiency in narcolepsy, and treatments ameliorating this deficiency are needed. ​.",2020.0

We conducted a prospective case control study of schizophrenia and comorbid narcolepsy type 1 in adolescents compared with patients with either diagnosis alone and healthy controls using 18F-fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography, sleep studies, and neurocognitive tests.

We included 11 patients (9-20 years old) with schizophrenia and comorbid narcolepsy type 1, 11 with narcolepsy type 1, 11 with schizophrenia, and 11 controls. All groups were matched for age and sex. Participants were required to submit to clinical interviews for sleep and psychiatric disorders, sleep questionnaires, continuous performance test, Wisconsin card sorting test, sleep studies including polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test and actigraphy, and positron emission tomography studies. All data were analyzed to compare the differences between the 4 groups.

The positron emission tomography results demonstrated significant differences in the dual diagnoses group compared with the 3 other groups. Compared with the controls, the dual diagnoses group had a significant presence of hypometabolism in the right mid-frontal, right orbital inferior frontal, and right posterior cingulum and a significant presence of hypermetabolism in the left amygdala, bilateral striatum, bilateral substantia nigra, bilateral basal ganglia, and bilateral thalamus. Continuous performance tests and Wisconsin card sorting tests showed that the dual diagnoses group had the worst performance.

It is characterized by sleep attacks, cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, sleep paralysis and sleep fragmentation in a pleomorphic presentation. The Narcolepsy Severity Scale (NSS), questionnaire which assesses the frequency and impact of the main symptoms of narcolepsy was developed in order to determine its clinical severity, needing translation, cultural adaptation and validation in many languages. The objective is to validate the Brazilian Portuguese version of the NSS.

The Brazilian version of the NSS was translated to Brazilian Portuguese and applied to patients with a diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 at the Daytime Excessive Sleepiness Service, at Psychobiology Department of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP) between February 2018 and July 2019.

A total of 52 patients completed the questionnaire. Cultural adaptations were made to better comprehension of patients. The Brazilian version of the NSS showed high internal consistency, demonstrated by the Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.82. It showed good reproducibility capacity, verified through the test-retest, whose intraclass correlation was 0.98. The average severity of Brazilian patients was 33.94 (±11.24), higher than the values found in other population, which also underwent validation of this scale. There was a correlation between sleep latency in diagnostic polysomnography and the NSS.

The Brazilian Portuguese version of NSS showed to be valid and reproducible tool for assessing the severity of patients with type 1 narcolepsy and have potential impact on clinical practice.",2020.0

This study is the first to assess the impact of a 5-nap protocol on meeting MSLT-derived diagnostic criteria in a general cohort referred for MSLT, without selection bias.

Data for all MSLTs performed at 2 tertiary sleep units in Australia between May 2012 and May 2018 were retrospectively assessed for the impact of the fifth nap on mean sleep latency (MSL) and sleep onset rapid eye movement periods.

There were 122 MSLTs included. The MSL was 8.7 ± 5.1 minutes after 4 naps, compared with 9.2 ± 5.2 minutes for 5 naps (P < .0001). In 8 cases, inclusion of the fifth nap changed the MSL to a value above the diagnostic threshold of 8 minutes. There were no instances in which the MSL moved to ≤ 8 minutes based on fifth nap data. A sleep onset rapid eye movement period occurred in the fifth nap in 9 patients and altered the interpretation in 2 cases.

The fifth nap in an MSLT is associated with an increased MSL, although this difference is rarely clinically significant. In patients with borderline MSL or 1 sleep onset rapid eye movement period after 4 naps, a fifth nap can alter the outcome and should be performed. However, for many cases, a 4-nap MSLT protocol will suffice, potentially allowing resource savings without compromising diagnostic accuracy. We propose the adoption of a conditional 4-nap or 5-nap protocol based on specific criteria.",2021.0

While there are several diagnostic tests for Narcolepsy such as MSLT (mean sleep latency test), polysomnography and low range of hypocretin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sensitivity and specificity in these methodologies are not sufficient enough. Therefore, methods with higher sensitivity for the accurate diagnosis and confirmation of the disease are necessary.

According to the infrequent prevalence of narcolepsy disease, we scheduled a case-control association study with 20 narcoleptic patients and 150 healthy individuals in a high-resolution HLA typing procedure employing SSP-PCR.

Our study demonstrates that the DQB1*06:02 allele provides the highest susceptibility with absolute risk of 0.13%, for Narcolepsy (P = 1x10-14, RR = 60.5, PcPPV = 0.13%), while, HLA-DQB1* 03:05 allele presents protection to Narcolepsy (P = 1x10-4, PcPPV = 3.19x10-4%). Furthermore, for the first time, the AA analysis displayed that AA serine182 and threonine185 located on epitope of DQβ1 chain receptor (DQB1Ser182,Thr185) present significant susceptibility for Narcolepsy (Pc= 87.03 × 10-13, PcPPV = 0.024%) while, asparagine182 located on epitope of DQβ1 protein receptor (DQB1Asn182) confers the highest protection against development of Narcolepsy (Pc= 2.16 × 10-5, PcPPV = 0.0012%).

Thus, this can be proposed that the polymorphic differences in the epitope of the HLA receptor could contribute to their differential association with the Narcolepsy in Iranian population.",2022.0

We aimed to test and validate the effectiveness of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency (REML), the REM sleep atonia index (RAI), and their combination for the automatic identification of pediatric patients with NT1 based on the standard scoring of nocturnal polysomnograms.

A retrospective cohort of 71 pediatric patients with NT1 and 42 controls was subdivided in test and validation cohorts. A novel index (COM) was developed as a nonlinear function of REML and RAI. The effectiveness of REML, RAI, and COM in identifying patients with NT1 was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

REML, RAI, and COM significantly identified patients with NT1 both in the test and validation cohorts. Optimal thresholds that maximized identification accuracy were estimated in the test cohort (REML, 49.5 min; RAI, 0.91; COM, 4.57 AU) and validated in the other cohort. COM performed significantly better in identifying patients with NT1 than either REML or RAI, with ROC area under the curve of 94%-100%, sensitivity 85%-96%, and specificity 92%-100%, and with good night-to-night agreement (Cohen's k = 0.69).

Symptoms include hepatosplenomegaly, vertical supranuclear saccadic palsy, ataxia, dystonia, and dementia. Some cases frequently display narcolepsy-like symptoms, including cataplexy which was reported in 26% of all NPC patients and was more often recorded among late-infantile onset (50%) and juvenile onset (38%) patients. In this current study, we examined CSF orexin levels in the 10 patients of NPC with and without cataplexy, which supports previous findings.

Ten patients with NPC were included in the study (5 males and 5 females). NPC diagnosis was biochemically confirmed in all 10 patients, from which 8 patients with NPC1 gene were identified. We compared CSF orexin levels among NPC, narcoleptic and idiopathic hypersomnia patients.

Six NPC patients with cataplexy had low or intermediate orexin levels. In 4 cases without cataplexy, their orexin levels were normal. In 5 cases with Miglustat treatment, their symptoms stabilized or improved. For cases without Miglustat treatment, their conditions worsened generally. The CSF orexin levels of NPC patients were significantly higher than those of patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy and lower than those of patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, which was considered as the control group with normal CSF orexin levels.

Our study indicates that orexin level measurements can be an early alert of potential NPC. Low or intermediate orexin levels could further decrease due to reduction in the neuronal function in the orexin system, accelerating the patients' NPC pathophysiology. However with Miglustat treatment, the orexin levels stabilized or improved, along with other general symptoms. Although the circuitry is unclear, this supports that orexin system is indeed involved in narcolepsy-cataplexy in NPC patients.

The NPC patients with cataplexy had low or intermediate orexin levels. In the cases without cataplexy, their orexin levels were normal. Our study suggests that orexin measurements can serve as an early alert for potential NPC; furthermore, they could be a marker of therapy monitoring during a treatment.",2020.0

Although observations on the characteristics of secondary narcolepsy have been published in adults, information on this topic in children is sparse. This is a retrospective study of characteristics and outcome of secondary narcolepsy in children. The medical records of 10 children with this condition at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, were reviewed. Characteristics of the underlying neurologic disorder, narcolepsy subtype, multiple sleep latency tests, medications used and outcome were extracted. Age at diagnosis of narcolepsy was between 6 and 17 years. Five of 10 patients had onset of excessive sleepiness within 1 year of diagnosis of the primary neurologic disorder. Six of 10 patients had type 1 narcolepsy (with cataplexy) whereas 4/10 had type 2 (without cataplexy).

Clinical information and sleep test results, extracted from hospital notes at 3 large pediatric sleep centers in England between September 2017 and June 2018 for narcolepsy cases aged 4-19 years with symptom onset since January 2009, were reviewed by an expert panel to confirm the diagnosis. Vaccination histories were independently obtained from general practitioners (GPs). The odds of vaccination in narcolepsy cases compared with the age-matched English population was calculated after adjustment for clinical conditions that were indications for vaccination. GP questionnaires were returned for 242 of the 244 children with confirmed narcolepsy. Of these 5 were under 5 years, 118 were 5-11 years, and 119 were 12-19 years old at diagnosis; 39 were vaccinated with Pandemrix before onset. The odds ratio (OR) for onset at any time after vaccination was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-2.89), The elevated risk period was restricted to onsets within 12 months of vaccination (OR 6.65 [3.44-12.85]) and was highest within the first 6 months. After one year, ORs were not significantly different from 1 up to 8 years after vaccination. The ORs were similar in under five-year-olds and older ages. The estimated attributable risk was 1 in 34,500 doses. Our study is limited by including cases from only 3 sleep centers, who may differ from cases diagnosed in nonparticipating centers, and by imprecision in defining the centers' catchment population. The potential for biased recall of onset shortly after vaccination in cases aware of the association cannot be excluded.

In this study, we found that vaccine-attributable cases have onset of narcolepsy within 12 months of Pandemrix vaccination. The attributable risk is higher than previously estimated in England because of identification of vaccine-attributable cases with late diagnoses. Absence of a compensatory drop in risk 1-8 years after vaccination suggests that Pandemrix does not trigger onsets in those in whom narcolepsy would have occurred later.",2020.0

In sum, 26 (52%) and 15 (30%) of participants had ADHD symptoms above and below the clinical significant cut-off, respectively, while 9 (18%) had no ADHD symptoms. High values were found for ADHD total score (mean (SD), 17.9 (9.5)) and ADHD subscores (inattentive score, 11.0 (6.3); hyperactive/impulsivity score, 6.9 (4.7)). These were significantly higher than previously reported in a mainly medicated narcolepsy cohort (p < 0.0001). Age, gender and disease duration did not influence scores. Two participants (4%) had ADHD diagnosis prior to narcolepsy onset. ADHD symptoms were correlated with parent-rated, but not with patient rated ESS scores, objective sleepiness (mean sleep latency), sleep fragmentation (sleep stage shift index, awakening index), or CSF hypocretin-1 level.

Comorbid ADHD symptoms were more prevalent in unmedicated post-H1N1 NT1 youths than previously reported in mainly medicated pediatric narcolepsy cohorts. The high prevalence was not due to pre-existing ADHD and generally not correlated with core narcolepsy sleep/wake phenotype characteristics, indicating that the ADHD symptoms were not a direct consequence of disturbed sleep or daytime sleepiness.",2020.0

Because of the difficulty in obtaining CSF, its clinical application is limited. Here, we aimed to confirm the significance of determining plasma orexin levels in the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy by comparing the differences in these levels between narcolepsy patients and healthy controls and analyzing related factors.

Twenty-four patients with type I narcolepsy who visited our hospital from October 2017 to January 2020 and who met the relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected. Simultaneously, healthy controls with matched basic characteristics were selected at a 1:1 proportion. Patient basic information was collected, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was recorded, the nocturnal polysomnogram and multiple sleep latency test were performed, and the patients' electrophysiological characteristics were analyzed. The blood samples of the patient and control groups were collected and stored at -80°Caftercentrifugation. Plasma orexin levels were determined by ELISA, following which the results of the two groups were compared, and the relevant factors were analyzed.

Our results revealed significantly lower plasma orexin levels in the narcolepsy patients compared to in healthy subjects. There were no correlations between plasma orexin levels and sex, age, body mass index, disease duration, and the severity of sleepiness, and between plasma orexin levels and electrophysiological indicators, including mean sleep latency and sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods.

The frequency of obesity (54% vs 17%), night eating (29% vs 7%), parasomnia (89% vs 43%), sleep talking (80% vs 34%), and sleep drunkenness (69% vs 24%) were higher in children than in adults, the frequency of sleep paralysis was lower (20% vs 55%) but the frequency of cataplexy and the severity of sleepiness were not different. Children scored higher than adults at the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) scale. Depressive feelings affected not differently children (24%) and adults (32%). However, adults had lower quality of life than children. There was no difference between groups for insomnia and fatigue scores. Quality of life was essentially impacted by depressive feelings in both children and adults. Obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was lower in children with higher mean and minimal oxygen saturation than in adults. No between-group differences were found at the multiple sleep latency test. The body mass index (z-score) was correlated with OAHI (r = .32).

At time of NC diagnosis, children have more frequent obesity, night eating, parasomnia, sleep talking, drunkenness, and ADHD symptoms than adults, even if sleepiness and cataplexy do not differ. These differences should be considered to ensure a prompt diagnosis.",2020.0
32726523,Screening for Excessive Daytime Sleepiness and Diagnosing Narcolepsy.,Winkelman JW,2020 Jul 21,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,"Sleep disorders such as narcolepsy can cause excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). However, the diagnosis of narcolepsy is often delayed by years in both children and adults, reducing their quality of life. Clinicians can improve the recognition of EDS and diagnosis of sleep disorders using screening tools such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, collecting sleep histories, and using sleep laboratory tests. By following up with patients who present with EDS and continuing to assess until a cause is found, clinicians can lessen the time to diagnosis and the negative impact of narcolepsy by initiating appropriate treatment.",2020.0

Here, we report a case of narcolepsy type 2 caused by hippocampal glioma of the right temporal lobe.

A 44-year-old male farmer complained of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) over the past 3 months and more.

The lesion of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was removed and its pathological examination was carried out.

General examination showed no abnormalities of his heart, lungs, or abdomen. Neurological examination showed no positive sign. The blood routine and biochemical examination were normal. He scored 7 on the Pittsburg sleep quality index, 16 on the Epworth sleepiness scale, 52 on the self-rating anxiety scale, and 48 on the self-rating depression scale. The multiple sleep latency test data showed 2 periods of sleep-onset rapid eyes movement period across 4 successive tests; the average sleep latency was under 8 minutes, and the rapid eyes movement latency was under 7 minutes. Lesion of glioma in hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and histological examination. After surgical removal of the glioma from the hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe, the patient's EDS symptoms disappeared immediately. He scored 3 on the Epworth sleepiness scale. During our follow-up three months later, he remained well with no complications.

We diagnosed the patient with narcolepsy type 2 according to the 3rd Edition of International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3).

The patient suffered from EDS and was diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2. The narcolepsy type 2 was linked to glioma of the hippocampus area. The hippocampus might be another part of regulating the sleep-arousal pathway, and the glioma secretion might interact with the orexin projection system.",2020.0

32554327,The influence of narcolepsy on olfactory function: a review.,de Martin Truzzi G; Naufel MF; Tufik S; Coelho FM,2020 Aug,Sleep medicine,"Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder associated with loss of hypocretin cells characterized by irrepressible need to sleep, often accompanied by cataplexy, sleep fragmentation, hypnagogical and hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It is also correlated with alterations in the sleep-wake cycle, dysautonomia, olfactory dysfunction, and eating disorders.

This is a review about influence of narcolepsy on human olfaction. Pubmed, Embase, Ovid and Cochrane databases were searched for articles on the evaluation of olfactory function in narcoleptic patients including terms as narcolepsy, olfaction disorder, amongst others.

Seven articles met the inclusion criteria. In five of them, the olfaction of narcoleptic patients was diminished in comparison with healthy control groups. The diagnosis of narcolepsy relates to worse performance in olfactory tests. Experimental researches showed that hypocretin and hypocretin receptors are present in the olfactory system, and this neuropeptide may have a role on olfactory sensitivity and on the olfactory modulation. The cause of hyposmia appears to be multifactorial. Among them, it stands out the hypocretin deficiency, therefore, that seems to be involved in the olfactory impairment in narcoleptic patients.",2020.0

This study reviews recent evidence for the association between narcolepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders. We also critically analyze studies that have addressed the neuropsychiatric correlates of patients with narcolepsy, with a discussion of the possible pathophysiological mechanisms linking narcolepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Neuropsychiatric manifestations are common among patients with narcolepsy as narcolepsy and some neuropsychiatric disorders share common clinical features. This may create challenges in making the correct diagnosis, and hence result in a delay in starting appropriate treatment. Comorbid neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients with narcolepsy include depression, anxiety, psychosis, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and cognitive impairment. Although hypocretin deficiency has been proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying both narcolepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders, further research is necessary to identify the exact mechanisms. Narcolepsy patients often manifest comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, which makes the diagnosis difficult. Therefore, it is essential to address neuropsychiatric symptoms in the clinical care of patients with narcolepsy.",2020.0
32393279,Protocols of a diagnostic study and a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing televisits vs standard in-person outpatient visits for narcolepsy diagnosis and care: TElemedicine for NARcolepsy (TENAR).,Ingravallo F; Vignatelli L; Pagotto U; Vandi S; Moresco M; Mangiaruga A; Oriolo C; Zenesini C; Pizza F; Plazzi G,2020 May 11,BMC neurology,"Narcolepsy is a rare chronic sleep disorder that typically begins in youth. Excessive daytime sleepiness is the main disabling symptom, but the disease is often associated with severe endocrine-metabolic and psychosocial issues, worsened by a long diagnostic delay, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. The scarcity of reference Sleep Centres forces the patient and family to travel for seeking medical consultations, increasing the economic and psychosocial burden of the disease. Growing evidence suggests that Telemedicine may facilitate patient access to sleep consultations and its non-inferiority in terms of patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and symptom improvement for sleep disorders. However, Telemedicine clinical and economic benefits for patients with narcolepsy are still unknown.

TENAR is a two-part project, including: 1. a cross-sectional study (involving 250 children and adults with suspected narcolepsy) evaluating the accuracy of Teletriage (i.e., a synchronous live interactive sleep assessment through a Televisit) for narcolepsy diagnosis compared to the reference standard; and 2. a two-arm, parallel, open randomized controlled trial (RCT) to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the multidisciplinary care of narcolepsy through Televisits versus standard care. In this RCT, 202 adolescents (> 14 y.o.) and adults with narcolepsy will be randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) either to Televisits via videoconference or to standard in-person outpatient follow-up visits (control arm). The primary outcome is sleepiness control (according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale). Secondary outcomes are other symptoms control, compliance with treatment, metabolic control, quality of life, feasibility, patient and family satisfaction with care, safety, and disease-related costs. At baseline and at 12 months, patients will undergo neurologic, metabolic, and psychosocial assessments and we will measure primary and secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes will be also measured at 6 months (remotely or in person, according to the arm).

TENAR project will assess, for the first time, the feasibility, accuracy, efficacy and safety of Telemedicine procedures applied to the diagnosis and the multidisciplinary care of children and adults with narcolepsy. The study may be a model for the remote management of other rare disorders, offering care access for patients living in areas lacking medical centres with specific expertise.

In this study, we report sleep-wake disturbances in children and adolescents with craniopharyngioma and associated clinical and treatment variables.

After surgery and prior to radiotherapy or observation, pediatric patients (n = 110) with craniopharyngioma ≥ 3 years old completed a baseline sleep clinic evaluation by a pediatric sleep specialist, polysomnography (PSG) and next-day multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). MSLT was limited to those ≥ 6 years old. Logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between patient characteristics and the presence and type of hypersomnia.

Amongst patients completing PSG and MSLT, 80% had polygraphic evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. Hypersomnia due to medical condition was diagnosed in 45% and narcolepsy in 35%. Overweight or obese patients were more likely to be diagnosed with hypersomnia (P = 0.012) or narcolepsy (P = 0.009). Grade 2 hypothalamic involvement (HI) at diagnosis was associated with the diagnosis of narcolepsy (P = 0.0008).

This study describes the prevalence and associated predictors of hypersomnia for patients with craniopharyngioma after surgical resection. HI was predictive of narcolepsy diagnosis, and a higher body mass index z-score was associated with hypersomnia due to medical condition and narcolepsy. We recommend that sleep assessment and intervention begin after surgical resection, especially in overweight or obese patients and those with extensive tumors.",2020.0

In this study, we define a DNS objective measure and evaluate its diagnostic utility for pediatric narcolepsy type 1 (NT1).

This was a retrospective, multisite, cross-sectional study of polysomnograms (PSGs) in 316 patients, ages 6-18 years (n = 150 NT1, n = 22 narcolepsy type 2, n = 27 idiopathic hypersomnia, and n = 117 subjectively sleepy subjects). We assessed sleep continuity PSG measures for (1) their associations with subjective and objective daytime sleepiness, daytime sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs), self-reported disrupted nocturnal sleep and CSF hypocretin levels and (2) their predictive value for NT1 diagnosis. We then combined the best performing DNS measure with nocturnal SOREMP (nSOREMP) to assess the added value to the logistic regression model and the predictive accuracy for NT1 compared with nSOREMP alone.

The Wake/N1 Index (the number of transitions from any sleep stage to wake or NREM stage 1 normalized by total sleep time) was associated with objective daytime sleepiness, daytime SOREMPs, self-reported disrupted sleep, and CSF hypocretin levels (p's < 0.003) and held highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) for NT1 diagnosis. When combined with nSOREMP, the DNS index had greater accuracy for diagnosing NT1 (AUC = 0.91 [0.02]) than nSOREMP alone (AUC = 0.84 [0.02], likelihood ratio [LR] test p < 0.0001).

The Wake/N1 Index is an objective DNS measure that can quantify DNS severity in pediatric NT1. The Wake/N1 Index in combination with or without nSOREMP is a useful sleep biomarker that improves recognition of pediatric NT1 using only the nocturnal PSG.",2020.0

However, we know little about adherence to prescribed treatment in narcolepsy. We assessed adherence to wakefulness-promoting agents in narcolepsy patients.

We retrospectively assessed adherence to wakefulness promoting medication in patients with narcolepsy using the Medicines Possession Ratio (MPR). Three levels of adherence were defined: poor (≤50%), intermediate (51-79%), and good (≥80%). Refractory daytime sleepiness was defined as an Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score >12 despite trialling at least three wakefulness-promoting agents. We compared demographic and clinical factors, and prescribed medications between patients, stratified by levels of adherence, as well as by presence or not of refractory sleepiness.

We included 116 patients with narcolepsy (54.3% female, mean age 39.4 (±14) years). In sum, 93 (80.2%) patients had a diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), and 23 (19.8%) of type 2 (NT2). Suboptimal symptom control was common: 39.8% had refractory sleepiness, and 47.3% of NT1 patients had persistent cataplexy. Good adherence was seen in only 55.2% of patients, while 12.9% were intermediately and 31.9% poorly adherent. Patients with poor adherence were more likely to have a diagnosis of NT2, but adherence did not vary according to gender, age, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidity, or the presence of apparent intractable symptoms. Levels of good adherence to therapy were no better in patients with refractory sleepiness than in those with satisfactory symptom control (56.5% vs 54.3%; p = 0.81).

Twenty-two drug-naive adult patients meeting the International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria for the diagnosis of NT1 referring to the Narcolepsy Center of the University of Bologna in the year 2017 underwent a semistructured interview focusing on their personal experiences during the cataplectic attacks. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed by thematic analysis of elementary contexts using T-LAB software.

The thematic analysis performed on the entire body text showed 3 clusters that explained 36.2%, 34.1%, and 29.7% of the variance, respectively: a cluster related to situations that trigger attacks of cataplexy, a cluster to bodily sensations, and another control strategies during episodes. The thematic content highlighted a tendency to disregard emotional experiences, thus affecting the ability to name, recognize, and regulate critical emotions.

The study showed that patients with NT1 spoke of their cataplectic attacks in terms of self-reported bodily experiences, trigger situations, and their management. Therefore, patients may have developed strategies of symptom management focused on emotion avoidance and/or inhibition.",2020.0
31999982,Utility of the sleep stage sequence preceding sleep onset REM periods for the diagnosis of narcolepsy: a study in a Japanese cohort.,Kawai R; Watanabe A; Fujita S; Hirose M; Esaki Y; Arakawa C; Iwata N; Kitajima T,2020 Apr,Sleep medicine,"The minimum narcolepsy criteria ""mean sleep latency (MSL) ≤8 min and ≥2 sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) on polysomnography (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT),"" according to The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3), are not specific to narcolepsy. Recently, the characteristic sleep stage sequences preceding SOREMPs in narcolepsy have received attention, but their diagnostic utility remains unclear.

We retrospectively reviewed PSG/MSLT records and chart data for 102 Japanese patients with hypersomnia and at least one SOREMP. We examined the sporadic rates of two sleep stage sequences preceding the SOREMPs-wakefulness or stage 1 to REM (W/S1→R) and stage 2 to REM (S2→R)-comparing these between patient groups with narcolepsy type 1 (N = 28), narcolepsy type 2 (N = 19), and other hypersomnia (N = 55). We also examined the utility of three simple indices using the occurrence of W/S1→R SOREMPs for distinguishing between narcolepsy and other hypersomnia in patients who satisfied the minimum narcolepsy criteria.

W/S1→R SOREMPs were significantly more frequent in narcolepsy than in other hypersomnia, and this tendency was also observed even in the patients who satisfied the minimum narcolepsy criteria. The three indices had moderate sensitivities and specificities for distinguishing between narcolepsy and other hypersomnia in patients satisfying the minimum narcolepsy criteria.

The W/S1→R pattern was observed significantly more frequently in narcolepsy than in other hypersomnia, suggesting it may help with differentiating narcolepsy from other hypersomnia in patients demonstrating the narcolepsy criteria, although its ability to do so may be modest.",2020.0

One hundred and forty-three consecutive untreated and 238 treated adults with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) completed the NSS, a 15-item self-administered questionnaire (score: 0-57) that assesses the severity and consequences of the five major narcolepsy symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disturbed nighttime sleep (DNS). They also completed the Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS; daytime sleepiness), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; depressive symptoms), and EQ5D (quality of life).

The mean symptom number (4.3 vs 3.5), NSS total score (33.3 ± 9.4 vs 24.3 ± 10.2), and number of narcolepsy symptoms (five symptoms: 53.1% vs 24.8%; four symptoms: 26.6% vs 22.7%; three symptoms: 15.4% vs 32.4%; two symptoms: 4.9% vs 20.2%) were significantly different between untreated and treated patients (p < 0.0001). DNS was often the third symptom (95.5 per cent). The symptom number was associated with diagnosis delay, age at onset, and ESS and BDI scores. Comparisons with ESS, BDI and EQ5D showed that NSS item weighting was not necessary to highlight between-group differences. Four NSS severity levels were defined (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe) with between-group differences related to treatment. The probability of having ESS ≥ 16, BDI ≥ 20, and EQ-5D < 60 increased with the severity level.

NSS is valid, reliable, and responsive to treatment in patients with NT1, with four clinically relevant severity score ranges provided. NSS has adequate clinimetric properties for broadening its use for both clinic and research.",2020.0

This multicenter, open-label, single-dose study of pitolisant 17.8 mg enrolled patients aged 6 through 17 years with a diagnosis of narcolepsy. Blood samples were collected at prespecified time points for analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0-10 h (AUC0-10h). Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared across three prespecified age groups: younger pediatric patients (aged 6 to <12 years), older pediatric patients (aged 12 to <18 years), and a historical comparison group of young adults (aged 18 to <45 years).

Of the 25 enrolled patients, 24 were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Pitolisant Cmax and AUC0-10h were greater (by 52% and 73%, respectively) in the younger (n = 12) versus older (n = 12) pediatric subgroup. These parameters were lower in the young adult group (n = 13) by 51% and 48%, respectively, compared with the older pediatric patients, and by 68% and 70%, respectively, compared with the younger pediatric patients. There were six treatment-emergent adverse events: headache (three), dizziness (one), diarrhea (one), and vomiting (one).

After single-dose administration, the exposure parameters of pitolisant were significantly greater in the younger compared with older pediatric patients with narcolepsy. Pitolisant doses up to 17.8 mg/d (in children with body weight <40 kg) or 35.6 mg/d are appropriate for further evaluation in pediatric patients.

A narcolepsy-cataplexy episode with associated hypertension and bradycardia was triggered during examination. There was no evidence of arrhythmia on electrocardiography during the episode. Hematology, serum biochemistry, and thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable. MRI of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were compatible with meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affecting the mesencephalon, pons and rostral medulla oblongata. The dog was started on immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone and cytosine arabinoside, which was subsequently switched to cyclosporine. Narcolepsy-cataplexy episodes could initially still be triggered by offering food; however, they gradually became shorter and less frequent until they completely subsided along with all other clinical signs after 3 wk. No relapse occurred over a 32 mo follow-up period from the diagnosis. Repeated MRI revealed marked reduction in the lesion size; cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed no abnormalities.

She also reported hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. A clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy was made. The prevailing pathophysiological concept of narcolepsy details ""partial intrusions of REM"" sleep into wakefulness. Healthy REM sleep includes generalized atonia, but with preservation of eye movements, respiratory function, and sphincter tone. Cataplexy recapitulates this pattern, and is often induced by extreme emotions, laughter in this case. Despite generalized and severe weakness and areflexia during this patient's cataplectic events, she was able to volitionally move her eyes, which is consistent with the physiology of REM sleep. The diagnosis of cataplexy is often missed, due to clinicians being unfamiliar with the findings and the lack of ability to induce sufficient emotional responses to trigger an episode.

Methods: Twenty-nine adults (93% female, mean age = 31 years) with an established diagnosis of narcolepsy (Type I = 58.6%) completed focus group interviews using live videoconferencing. Additionally, participants completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures along with legacy measures commonly used in narcolepsy research (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, Short-Form 36). Results: Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed that HRQoL was impacted by the constancy of sleepiness, unpredictability of narcolepsy symptoms, and negative public perception of narcolepsy. Challenges to accessibility and/or quality of care included dissatisfaction with non-sleep specialists' understanding of narcolepsy, the unpredictability of symptoms, and the cost of health care. There was enthusiasm for developing a psychosocial intervention to improve HRQoL using online access, but there were mixed opinions regarding the format, provider background, and content of the intervention. Elevations (T-score > 60) were found on PROMIS measures of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep impairment. These patterns were consistent with the levels reported on legacy measures. PWN Type I reported lower levels of general health relative to Type II (p < .05). Conclusions: These findings lay the groundwork for more targeted efforts to address areas of diminished HRQoL in PWN.

Baseline PROs suggested excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS 14.2 ± 5.2 [74% patients > 10]), significant fatigue (FSS 47.5 ± 12.9), and mild depression (PHQ-9 9.0 [4.0, 14.0] [49.4% ≥ 10]). At follow-up, ESS and PHQ-9 improved significantly overall and within diagnostic, monotherapy/polytherapy, and SO use groups (all P < .01). FSS improved significantly overall (P = .016), but improvements were not significant for IH, monotherapy, polytherapy, and non-SO using groups. In multivariable models, PRO changes were not significantly different between groups, but baseline STD was associated with worsening PHQ-9 across PHQ-9 change models, and ESS worsened with increasing STD at follow-up (P = .056).

Significant improvements in sleep-related PROs were seen with pharmacotherapy use, regardless of diagnosis or treatment type, highlighting the importance of individualized prescribing decisions for this population.",2019.0

Additional analyses compared narcolepsy type 1 and type 2.

This retrospective cross-sectional study identified US patients with narcolepsy <18 years of age with ≥2 claims with a diagnosis code of narcolepsy using Truven MarketScan® data 2011 to 2015. Patients were matched to controls without narcolepsy. Comorbid conditions, health care utilization, and costs were measured by calendar year. P values are nominal, and no adjustments for multiplicity or multiple comparisons were made.

A total of 1427 pediatric patients with narcolepsy were identified and matched with 4281 controls from 2011 to 2015. Patients with narcolepsy had more comorbid conditions (mean 5.8 vs 2.4, nominal P < 0.001). Respiratory diseases and mood disorders were more common in patients with narcolepsy than controls (57% vs 32% and 56% vs 14%, respectively; both nominal P < 0.001). Compared to controls, patients with narcolepsy underwent more diagnostic tests (electroencephalogram, EEG [0.13 vs 0.0053]) and brain computed tomography, CT/magnetic resonance imaging, MRI (0.26 vs 0.022; both nominal P < 0.001). Mean annual inpatient days (0.71 vs 0.15), emergency department visits (0.51 vs 0.15), and outpatient office visits (8.6 vs 2.3) were higher for patients with narcolepsy than controls (all nominal P < 0.001). Annual mean health care costs were higher for patients with narcolepsy versus controls ($15,797 vs $2449, nominal P < 0.001).

The typical manifestations of cataplectic facies consist of repetitive mouth opening, tongue protrusion, and ptosis. An interesting observation is that the usual emotional triggers associated with cataplexy such as laughter and joking are not always present, thus hampering diagnosis of the underlying syndrome. Cataplectic facies is thought to be a phenomenon observed in the early stages of narcolepsy type 1 and is thought to disappear by the time the patient reaches puberty. We present a unique case of an elderly woman with narcolepsy type 1 demonstrating cataplectic facies. The novel circumstances of this case highlight that facial cataplexy can present later in life, in contrast with previous descriptions that report resolution of cataplectic facies before puberty. Wider recognition of these features throughout the life course may aid in accurate diagnosis and thereby ensure swift access to appropriate treatment.",2019.0

REM sleep behavior disorder or sleepiness can be warning signs of future WD. These early symptoms may significantly reduce the time to WD diagnosis. Early anti-copper therapies (chelators or zinc salts), reducing copper accumulation in the brain and though saving brain tissue, can allow the complete disappearance of these sleep disorders and of course improve the other symptoms of WD. Insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are present in WD and should be explored with video polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test. Suggested immobilization test could be useful in the diagnosis of RLS in WD. Motor and non-motor symptoms, dysautonomic dysfunctions, drugs, and lesions of the circuits regulating wake and sleep may be involved in the mechanisms of these sleep abnormalities. Adapted treatments should be proposed.",2019.0

Diagnosis Clomipramine was temporarily discontinued in order to confirm a suspected diagnosis of narcolepsy using Multiple Sleep Latency Testing. This precipitated an episode of status cataplecticus which resolved with re-introduction of therapy. A diagnosis of narcolepsy was later confirmed with undetectable levels of hypocretin/orexin in the CSF. Treatment Re-introduction of clomipramine led to resolution of status cataplecticus. The patient now remains stable with regards to his cataplexy on clomipramine 30mg. Discussion There have been a total of 4 case reports of status cataplecticus following withdrawal of antidepressant therapy. In all cases, reintroduction of anti-cataplectic therapy led to resolution of attacks. The abrupt discontinuation of an SSRI is believed to precipitate cataplexy attacks due to reduction in noradrenergic tone.",2019.0

The diagnosis is made on the basis of diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy. On average, it takes about 7-10 years to diagnose narcolepsy that reduces the quality of life of patients and leads to social and household maladaptation.

Ninety post-H1N1 NT1 patients and 202 of their first-degree relatives were HLA-genotyped (next generation sequencing) and phenotyped (semistructured interviews, Stanford Sleep Questionnaire, polysomnography, and multiple sleep latency test). HLA allele distributions were compared between DQB1*06:02-heterozygous individuals (77 patients, 59 parents, 1230 controls). A subsample (74 patients, 114 relatives) was investigated for associations between HLA-loci and continuous sleep variables using logistic regression. Identified candidate HLA-loci were explored for HLA allele associations with hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis in 90 patients, and patient allele findings were checked for similar associations in 202 relatives.

DQB1*06:02 heterozygous post-H1N1 NT1 patients (84.4% H1N1-vaccinated) showed several significant HLA associations similar to those reported previously in samples of mainly sporadic NT1, i.e. DQB1*03:01, DRB1*04:01, DRB1*04:02, DRB1*04:07, DRB1*11:04, A*25:01, B*35:03, and B*51:01, and novel associations, i.e. B*14:02, C*01:02, and C*07:01. Parents HLA alleles did not deviate significantly from controls. The HLA-C locus was associated with sleep parameters in patients and relatives. In patients C*02:02 seems to be associated with protective effects against sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations.

Our findings of similar risk/protective HLA-alleles in post-H1N1 as in previous studies of mainly sporadic narcolepsy support similar disease mechanisms. We also report novel allelic associations. Associations between HLA-C and sleep parameters were seen independent of NT1 diagnosis, supporting involvement of HLA-C in sleep subphenotypes.",2020.0

Clinical, neurophysiologic, and, when available, biological data (HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity, CSF hcrt-1 levels) of 357 consecutive children below 18 years of age evaluated for suspected narcolepsy were collected. Best MSLT cutoffs were obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis by contrasting among patients with available CSF hcrt-1 assay (n = 228) with vs without CSF hcrt-1 deficiency, and further validated in patients without available CSF hcrt-1 against cataplexy (n = 129).

Patients with CSF hcrt-1 deficiency were best recognized using a mean MSLT sleep latency ≤8.2 minutes (area under the ROC curve of 0.985), or by at least 2 SOREMPs at the MSLT (area under the ROC curve of 0.975), or the combined PSG + MSLT (area under the ROC curve of 0.977). Although specificity and sensitivity of reference MSLT sleep latency ≤8 minutes and ≥2 SOREMPs (nocturnal SOREMP included) was 100% and 94.87%, the combination of MSLT sleep latency and SOREMP counts did not improve diagnostic accuracy. Age or sex also did not significantly influence these results in our pediatric population.

At least 2 SOREMPs or a mean sleep latency ≤8.2 minutes at the MSLT are valid and reliable markers for pediatric NT1 diagnosis, a result contrasting with adult NT1 criteria.

RSWA is essential for the diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), but can also occur without dream-enacting behavior. Loss of atonia during REM sleep is considered as a biomarker for synucleinopathies. We will give an overview of the pathophysiology of RSWA and will highlight the diagnostic methods for RSWA. We will describe the different etiologies of RSWA and finally we will focus on the role of RSWA as biomarker for Lewy body disease. RSWA severity in isolated RBD patients is a potential predictor for early conversion to Parkinson's disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies. In PD patients, RSWA severity is associated with more severe motor symptoms and disease progression. Future studies are needed to delineate the importance of isolated RSWA as prodromal marker of Lewy body disease.",2019.0

Neurology,"Narcolepsy is a rare brain disorder that reflects a selective loss or dysfunction of orexin (also known as hypocretin) neurons of the lateral hypothalamus. Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, accompanied by sleep-wake symptoms, such as hallucinations, sleep paralysis and disturbed sleep. Diagnosis is based on these clinical features and supported by biomarkers: evidence of rapid eye movement sleep periods soon after sleep onset; cerebrospinal fluid orexin deficiency; and positivity for HLA-DQB1*06:02. Symptomatic treatment with stimulant and anticataplectic drugs is usually efficacious. This Review focuses on our current understanding of how genetic, environmental and immune-related factors contribute to a prominent (but not isolated) orexin signalling deficiency in patients with NT1. Data supporting the view of NT1 as a hypothalamic disorder affecting not only sleep-wake but also motor, psychiatric, emotional, cognitive, metabolic and autonomic functions are presented, along with uncertainties concerning the 'narcoleptic borderland', including narcolepsy type 2 (NT2). The limitations of current diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy are discussed, and a possible new classification system incorporating the borderland conditions is presented.

The study included 74 adult patients with narcolepsy and 265 controls matched for age and sex. Narcolepsy diagnosis was made according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition. Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed via using a validated Arabic version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview DSM-IV (MINI version 6). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the potential influence of narcolepsy on the comorbidity of psychiatric disorders.

The mean age of the patients was 29.4 ± 10.2 years, and males accounted for 81% of the study sample. Forty-four patients (60%) were diagnosed with narcolepsy type-1 (NT1) and 30 (40%) with narcolepsy type-2 (NT2). Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 45% of patients with narcolepsy compared with 15% of the controls (p < 0.001).

Although immunoassays are prone to antibody batch differences, detection methods and variation between laboratories, the standard method for Hcrt1 measurement is a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is an antibody- and radioactive free alternative for precise measurement of Hcrt1. We developed an LC-MS/MS method for measurement of Hcrt1 in CSF with automated sample preparation by solid-phase extraction (SPE). The LC-MS/MS method was compared with the RIA method for Hcrt1 detection. CSF samples from healthy subjects and NT1 patients was obtained by lumbar puncture. NT1 patients were diagnosed according to the minimal criteria by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD). The LC-MS/MS method showed linearity across the range of calibrators and had a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.5 pg/mL and a limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 3.6 pg/mL. Comparison of the LC-MS/MS method with RIA revealed a 19 times lower level in healthy controls and 22 times lower level in NT1 patients with the LC-MS/MS method than with RIA. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated agreement between the methods. These results question what is detected by RIA and strongly suggest that the physiological concentrations of the peptide are much lower than previously believed. LC-MS/MS proves to be an alternative for detection of Hcrt1 for diagnosis of narcolepsy.",2019.0

In this mini-review, we summarized EDS features in CNS hypersomnias to provide a guide for differential diagnosis purposes.

A review of recent literature was performed to provide an update in CNS hypersomnias.

At clinical evaluation, narcolepsy patients report a good restorative potential of sleep together with the frequent occurrence of dreaming even during short-lasting naps. These features are mirrored by the neurophysiological evidence of REM sleep at sleep onset (SOREMP) during the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), a specific marker. Conversely, patients with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) complain sleep inertia and prolonged nocturnal sleep. Polysomnographic studies show high sleep propensity on the MSLT or high 24-h total sleep time during continuous monitoring. Patients with insufficient sleep syndrome (ISS) can present with variable clinical EDS features in between narcolepsy and IH. ISS diagnosis is based on the clinical evidence of nocturnal sleep curtailment (weekdays versus vacations) associated with the disappearance of EDS complaint after sleep extension. Polysomnographic data are not required, but when the MSLT is performed, ISS patients can present with SOREMP arising from non-REM stage 2 sleep (vs narcolepsy patients entering into SOREM most frequently from wakefulness). Kleine-Levin Syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of enormously prolonged sleep time lasting days associated with abnormal cognition and behavior intermixed by asymptomatic periods, a sleep pattern that can be well documented by actigraphy.

Different CNS hypersomnias present with specific features of EDS are useful to guide the clinician to apply and interpret appropriate neurophysiological investigations.",2020.0

We used data from the Bern Sleep-Wake Database to investigate the discriminating capacity of both the SNS and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to identify narcolepsy type 1 and type 2 in patients with central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH) or sleepy patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In addition, we aimed to develop a simplified version of the SNS. We created the two-item short-form SNS (sSNS), based on the discriminative capability of the models including all possible combinations of the five questions of the SNS. Using the previously published co-efficiencies, we confirmed the high capacity of the SNS in identifying narcolepsy type 1. The updated SNS (based on new co-efficiencies and cutoff) and the sSNS showed high capacity and were both superior to ESS in identifying narcolepsy type 1. The sSNS correlated significantly with the SNS (r = - 0.897, p < 0.001). No scale showed sufficient discrimination for narcolepsy type 2. This is the largest cohort study that confirms the discriminating power of SNS for narcolepsy type 1 in patients with hypersomnolence and the first study to assess its discriminative power for narcolepsy type 2. The easy-to-use and easy-to-calculate short-form scale has a high discriminating power for narcolepsy type 1 and may be used as screening tool, especially among general practitioners, to identify patients and accelerate their referral to a center of expertise.",2019.0

Vaccine exposure in approximately 30% of the Swedish population in 2009 was linked to information on narcolepsy diagnosis retrieved from the national patient registry. Cases were verified by a systematic chart review. Poisson regression was used to compare incidence in defined time windows following vaccination.

Of 266 cases of narcolepsy identified, 25% (66/266) were prevalent cases with symptom onset documented before vaccine exposure. Incident cases had a median time interval between first symptom and the date recorded in the patient registry of 64 weeks (IQR 39-107) when vaccinated (N = 182) and 65 weeks (IQR 51-72) when unvaccinated (N = 16). With first symptom defining index date, the adjusted risk for narcolepsy in younger patients was increased 14 times during the first year after vaccination, three times elevated the second year, but with no detectable increased risk more than 2 years after vaccination exposure. Using the index date from the patient registry, the adjusted increase in risk was about seven times elevated for all three time intervals.

The magnitude of the estimated increased risk for narcolepsy following exposure to the A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine is highly dependent on the method used to determine the index date for disease onset.

The Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Dissertation Database (THMCDD) was used to estimate prevalence and incidence of narcolepsy, with and without cataplexy, by age groups, gender, and region among patients under age 66 years with continuous enrollment for years 2008-2010. THMCDD contains health claims information for more than 18 million people. Prevalence was expressed as cases/100 000 persons. Average annual incidence (using varying criteria for latency between the diagnostic tests, polysomnograph coupled with multiple sleep latency test [MSLT], and the diagnosis) was expressed as new cases/100 000 persons/year.

There were 8 444 517 continuously enrolled patients and 6703 diagnosed with narcolepsy (prevalence overall: 79.4/100 000; without cataplexy: 65.4/100 000; with cataplexy: 14.0/100 000). On the basis of the three definitions of incidence, overall average annual incidence was 7.67, 7.13, and 4.87/100 000 persons/year. Incidence for narcolepsy without cataplexy was generally several times higher than narcolepsy with cataplexy. Prevalence and incidence were approximately 50% greater for females compared to males across most age groups. Prevalence was highest among the 21-30 years age group, with incidence highest among enrollees in their early 20s and late teens. Regionally, the North Central United States had the highest prevalence and incidence, whereas the West was the lowest.

We found greater prevalence and incidence of narcolepsy (including without cataplexy) than most previous studies.

A retrospective cohort study of 42 children seen in a single tertiary pediatric neurology center between 1996 and 2016.

Onset of symptoms of narcolepsy occurred between infancy and 15 years, with 92.9% of children symptomatic by 13 years. Time from reported symptom onset to diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 11 years, with 51.3% diagnosed within 12 months of symptom onset. Those patients who were reportedly symptomatic from birth had a statistically significant increased time from reported symptom onset to diagnosis.

The symptoms of childhood narcolepsy progress over time. The number of annual diagnoses in this center increased over the study period, but there is no evidence that the time from symptom onset to diagnosis is decreasing. Being reportedly symptomatic from the age of <1 year is associated with an increased time to diagnosis. We recommend raising awareness of narcolepsy among medical students and general practitioners. It is important that clinicians appreciate the clinical relevance of excessive daytime sleepiness.",2019.0

The study included 55 consecutive patients with type-1 and type-2 narcolepsy who attended the narcolepsy clinic between August 2017 and December 2017. Narcolepsy was diagnosed according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-third edition criteria. We evaluated sociodemographic data, the specialties visited, and diagnoses and treatments received prior to visiting a sleep specialist.

The mean diagnostic delay was 9.1 ± 8.4 years (1-43 years). Multiple linear regression analysis identified early onset as the only predictor of a delayed diagnosis (β coefficient = - 0.262, p = 0.03). EDS was the main symptom that prompted patients to seek medical consultation, and only one patient had been (1.8%) referred with the diagnosis of narcolepsy. In the study group, 82% of the patients were misdiagnosed with a mental or neurological disorder or were thought to be afflicted by ""envy,"" ""evil eye,"" or ""black magic"" before receiving a correct diagnosis.

30803831,The role of home sleep testing for evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness: focus on obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy.,Rosenberg R; Hirshkowitz M; Rapoport DM; Kryger M,2019 Apr,Sleep medicine,"Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common complaint in the general population, which may be associated with a wide range of sleep disorders and other medical conditions. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized primarily by EDS, which involves a substantial burden of illness but is often overlooked or misdiagnosed. In addition to identifying low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin (orexin) levels, evaluation for narcolepsy requires in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). Polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as well as other sleep disorders. However, the use of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) to screen for OSA in adults with EDS has increased greatly based on its lower cost, lower technical complexity, and greater convenience, versus PSG. The most commonly used, types 3 and 4, portable monitors for HSAT lack capability for electroencephalogram recording, which is necessary for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders and is provided by PSG. These limitations, combined with the increased use of HSAT for evaluation of EDS, may further exacerbate the under-recognition of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias, either as primary or comorbid disorders with OSA. Adherence to expert consensus guidelines for use of HSAT is essential. Differential clinical characteristics of patients with narcolepsy and OSA may help guide correct diagnosis. Continued EDS in patients diagnosed and treated for OSA may indicate comorbid narcolepsy or another sleep disorder.

Here, we report a small case series of four narcolepsy patients seen over a four year period in the sleep clinic of a tertiary care hospital in north India. The diagnosis was established by clinical history and two or more sleep-onset rapid eye movements (SOREMs) on multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) following overnight polysomnography (PSG). The mean age of patients was 26.2±6.4 yr; one patient had associated cataplexy and another one had all four cardinal symptoms of narcolepsy. All these patients had a history of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The mean body mass index was 24.2±4.7 kg/m[2]. The mean sleep latency during MSLT was 2.7±1.3 min, and the mean REM latency was 5.7±2.9 min. Narcolepsy, although rarely reported from India, should be suspected in young non-obese patients complaining of EDS and confirmed by performing MSLT following overnight PSG.",2018.0

30679597,HPLC analysis of CSF hypocretin-1 in type 1 and 2 narcolepsy.,Sakai N; Matsumura M; Lin L; Mignot E; Nishino S,2019 Jan 24,Scientific reports,"Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder caused by a loss of hypocretin (hcrt) neurons in the hypothalamus. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hcrt-1 measurement has been well established as a gold standard of narcolepsy diagnosis, although some portions of narcoleptic patients show normal hcrt-1 levels. We aimed to examine peptide degradation of hcrt-1 and its abnormality in the CSF of patients by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by radioimmunoassay (RIA). CSF was collected from healthy controls, narcoleptic patients of type 1 with hcrt-1 deficiency, type 1 with normal hcrt-1 level, and type 2 with normal hcrt-1 level. We found that the majority of hcrt-1 immunoreactivity in extracted CSF was derived from unauthentic hcrt-1 peaks, which are predicted to be inactive metabolites, and the intact hcrt-1 peptide was less than 10% of the gross amount, suggesting that the regular RIA for CSF hcrt-1 measures largely reflect the unauthentic hcrt-1-related metabolites rather than the intact one. As expected, all hcrt-1-related peaks were abolished in type 1 with hcrt-1 deficiency. Importantly, we also found that the sum of the authentic hcrt-1 peptide (peaks 3 and 4) significantly decreased in non-deficient type 1 and tended to decrease in type 2 narcoleptic patients although the levels with the regular RIA in non-extracted CSF was equivalent to healthy controls. Immunoreactivity with unauthentic hcrt-1 metabolites may masks the possible decline in authentic hcrt-1 level caused by the partial loss of hcrt neurons. Our findings may provide new insights into the degradation of the hcrt-1 peptide and the pathophysiology of narcolepsy.",2019.0
30649557,Sleepiness and sleepiness perception in patients with Parkinson's disease: a clinical and electrophysiological study.,Bargiotas P; Lachenmayer ML; Schreier DR; Mathis J; Bassetti CL,2019 Apr 1,Sleep,"The main objective of the study was to assess the prevalence, the severity, and the daytime course of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and to explore how people with PD perceive the degree and onset of their sleepiness during objective sleepiness tests. In addition, the occurrence of early-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (sleep-onset REM periods [SOREMPs]) in PD was assessed.

We analyzed data from 46 people with PD (26 males, mean age 63.5 years, mean UPDRS-III-OFF 34.7). The sleep-wake assessment included Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), and objective (polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test [MSLT], and maintenance of wakefulness tests [MWT]) measures.

Subjective (ESS ≥ 10) and objective (mean sleep latency, MSL < 5 min in MSLT) EDS were present in 43% and 41% of patients, respectively. The MSL in MSLT and MWT remained unchanged throughout the day and significantly correlated with KSS during the trial but not with KSS shortly before it. In MWT, about one-fourth of patients failed to signal their sleepiness before falling asleep. SOREMPs, usually (83%) arising from NREM1 or wake, were recorded in 24% of the patients. People with SOREMPs had significantly lower MSL in MSLT and MWT and higher AHI compared with those without SOREMPs.

Patients with PD exhibit daylong increased EDS but they underestimate its degree and often fail to signal its onset. SOREMPs in PD have a ""narcoleptic"" character in sleep-stage sequencing and are associated with the presence of sleep-disturbed breathing. These results add to our understanding of sleepiness and sleepiness perception in PD and have important implications for its diagnosis and management.",2019.0

This study sought to determine the perioperative experience of narcoleptic patients undergoing anesthesia or sedation, the frequency of perioperative counseling, and self-reported surgical complications.

A 22-question survey was developed by expert consensus and distributed by the Narcolepsy Network. Recruitment was via the Narcolepsy Network's list-serve and a Facebook link to the survey. One thousand and twenty respondents reported a diagnosis of narcolepsy and 1 or more procedures under anesthesia or sedation. Descriptive, comparative statistics and logistic regression were utilized.

Respondents were mostly women (79.5%) and Caucasian (84.9%), with a mean age of 45 ± 16 years. Most respondents did not receive counseling regarding the possibility of increased sleepiness (70%), cataplexy (90%), or drowsy driving (59%) postanesthesia. More than half of respondents reported adverse events (medication withdrawal symptoms, inadequate pain relief, increased cataplexy). Subjects with cataplexy more frequently reported surgical complications (70% vs 31%; P = .03) and medication withdrawal symptoms (stimulant medications: odds ratio, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.9, 3.06]; P > .001 and antidepressant medications: odds ratio, 6.5 [95% CI, 2.1-19.5]; P = .001). Of the total sample, 18% indicated surgical complications. Undergoing 5 or more separate surgeries or procedures was associated with a 2-fold increase in self-reported complications (odds ratio, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-3.4]; P = .001), difficulty waking (odds ratio, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.45-3.06]; P = .001), and inadequate pain relief (odds ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.01-3.13]; P < .05).

Most narcoleptic patients report not receiving counseling regarding potential worsening of narcolepsy symptoms postanesthesia or an increased risk of drowsy driving. Enhanced education of perioperative providers about potential narcolepsy-related issues is essential. Respondents frequently self-report adverse events in the perioperative period. Future studies should clarify the perioperative risk associated with narcolepsy to optimize the care and safety of narcoleptic patients.",2019.0

The diagnosis is typically made after a long delay that burdens the disease severity. The aim of the project, promoted by the ""Associazione Italiana Narcolettici e Ipersonni"" is to develop Red Flags to detect symptoms for early referral, targeting non-sleep medicine specialists, general practitioners, and pediatricians.

A multidisciplinary panel, including patients, public institutions, and representatives of national scientific societies of specialties possibly involved in the diagnostic process of suspected narcolepsy, was convened. The project was accomplished in three phases. Phase 1: Sleep experts shaped clinical pictures of narcolepsy in pediatric and adult patients. On the basis of these pictures, Red Flags were drafted. Phase 2: Representatives of the scientific societies and patients filled in a form to identify barriers to the diagnosis of narcolepsy. Phase 3: The panel produced suggestions for the implementation of Red Flags.

Red Flags were produced representing three clinical pictures of narcolepsy in pediatric patients ((1) usual sleep symptoms, (2) unusual sleep symptoms, (3) endocrinological signs) and two in adult patients ((1) usual sleep symptoms, (2) unusual sleep symptoms). Inadequate knowledge of symptoms at onset by medical doctors turned out to be the main reported barrier to diagnosis.

This report will hopefully enhance knowledge and awareness of narcolepsy among non-specialists in sleep medicine in order to reduce the diagnostic delay that burdens patients in Italy. Similar initiatives could be promoted across Europe.",2019.0

Accuracy of sleep stage scoring was validated in 70 subjects assessed by six scorers. The best model performed better than any individual scorer (87% versus consensus). It also reliably scores sleep down to 5 s instead of 30 s scoring epochs. A T1N marker based on unusual sleep stage overlaps achieved a specificity of 96% and a sensitivity of 91%, validated in independent datasets.

UNS questionnaires of 267 participants visiting Helsinki Sleep Clinic were analyzed. The diagnoses of the participants were narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, n = 89), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2, n = 10), other hypersomnias (n = 24), sleep apnea (n = 37), restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder (n = 56), and other sleep-related disorders (n = 51). In addition, ESS and SNS scores in a subset of sample (total N = 167) were analyzed and compared to UNS.

Mean UNS score in NT1 was 22.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.4 to 23.6, range 9-43), which was significantly higher than in other disorders, including NT2 (mean 13.7, 95% CI = 10.3 to 17.1, range 7-21, p = .0013). Sensitivity and specificity of UNS in separating NT1 from other disorders were 83.5% and 84.1%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 82.5% and 85.1%, respectively. Sensitivities of SNS and ESS in NT1 were 77.2% and 88.6%, and specificities 88.6% and 45.5%, respectively. There were no differences in receiver operating characteristic curves between UNS and SNS. UNS had moderate negative correlation with hypocretin-1 levels (rs = -.564, p < .001), and mean sleep latency in multiple sleep latency test (rs= -.608, p < .001).

UNS has high specificity and sensitivity for NT1 in a sleep clinic setting. UNS scores below 9 strongly suggest against the diagnosis of narcolepsy.",2019.0

Incidence rates were used to assess a signal of narcolepsy following AS03-adjuvanted monovalent pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza vaccination among children and adolescents in Sweden and Finland in 2010. We explored the utility of ecological data to assess incidence of narcolepsy following exposure to pandemic H1N1 virus or vaccination in 10 sites that used different vaccines, adjuvants, and had varying vaccine coverage.

We calculated incidence rates of diagnosed narcolepsy for periods defined by influenza virus circulation and vaccination campaign dates, and used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing the periods during which wild-type virus circulated and after the start of vaccination campaigns vs. the period prior to pH1N1 virus circulation. We used electronic health care data from Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Canada (3 provinces), Taiwan, Netherlands, and Spain (2 regions) from 2003 to 2013. We investigated interactions between age group and adjuvant in European sites and conducted a simulation study to investigate how vaccine coverage, age, and the interval from onset to diagnosis may impact the ability to detect safety signals.

Incidence rates of narcolepsy varied by age, continent, and period. Only in Taiwan and Sweden were significant time-period-by-age-group interactions observed. Associations were found for children in Taiwan (following pH1N1 virus circulation) and Sweden (following vaccination). Simulations showed that the individual-level relative risk of narcolepsy was underestimated using ecological methods comparing post- vs. pre-vaccination periods; this effect was attenuated with higher vaccine coverage and a shorter interval from disease onset to diagnosis.

Ecological methods can be useful for vaccine safety assessment but the results are influenced by diagnostic delay and vaccine coverage. Because ecological methods assess risk at the population level, these methods should be treated as signal-generating methods and drawing conclusions regarding individual-level risk should be avoided.",2018.0

A systematic meta-analysis.,Capittini C; De Silvestri A; Terzaghi M; Scotti V; Rebuffi C; Pasi A; Manni R; Martinetti M; Tinelli C,2018 Dec,Sleep medicine,"we performed a meta-analysis to assess the usefulness of HLA testing for Narcolepsy diagnosis in four major ethnical groups: Asians, Afro-Americans, Amerindians and Caucasians.

PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched for articles in English and French published before October 2017 on HLA class II alleles in Narcolepsy. We included case-control studies, cross-sectional and retrospective cohort studies with patients diagnosed following the International classifications of sleep disorders (1990-2012) and ethnically matched controls. Following PRISMA guidelines, two investigators independently extracted data according to the inclusion criteria listed in PROSPERO CRD42017058677. A third researcher was consulted for discrepancies. We extracted and pooled adjusted OR using random-effect models. We verified the strength of the association between HLA-DQB1*06:02 and the worldwide distribution of Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and type 2 (NT2); furthermore, we pooled the OR measuring the association between HLA-DQB1*06:02 and NT1, NT2 and hypersomniacs.

We identified 511 titles. Of these, 12 case-control studies were included, for a total of 2077 NT1 patients, 235 NT2 patients, 161 hypersomniacs and 7802 controls. In the population-stratified analysis, HLA-DQB1*06:02 conferred an increased risk for NT1 (OR: 24.1, IC: 14.6-39.5, p < 0.001) and NT2 (OR: 3.9; IC: 2.2-6.8, p < 0.001). For NT1 the pooled estimated positive Likelihood Ratio (LR+) was 5.94 (IC: 3.71-9.51) and the negative Likelihood Ratio (LR-) was 0.23 (IC: 0.16-0.33); for NT2 LR+ was 3.35 (IC: 2.08-5.38) and LR- 0.72 (IC: 0.63-0.81). Moreover, for hypersomniacs LR+ was 1.436 (IC 0.668-3.089) and LR- 0.903 (IC 0.714-1.142).

Here, we aimed to test those findings using another actigraph model with a different clinical sample as control (ie, primary insomniacs, PI), carrying out a secondary analysis of previously collected data.

The study sample consisted of 13 NT1 (nine females; mean age 39.38 ± 11.48), 13 PI (nine females; mean age 38.69 ± 10.72) and 13 Healthy Controls (HC) (nine females; mean age 38 ± 10.77). Participants wore the Actiwatch AW64 (Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd, Cambridge, UK) around the non-dominant wrist for seven consecutive days.

Significant differences between groups were observed with a higher number of episodes of wakefulness (wake bouts, WB) in PI than HC, a higher fragmentation index (FI) in NT1 than HC and PI, a higher duration of the longest nap (LNAP) in NT1 than HC and PI and higher DS in PI and NT1 than HC. A new DS (NDS), with LNAP and FI as independent variables, was proposed; which was higher in NT1 than HC and PI.

Here we used sensitive cellular screens and detected hypocretin-specific CD4+ T cells in all 19 patients that we tested; T cells specific for tribbles homologue 2-another self-antigen of hypocretin neurons-were found in 8 out of 13 patients. Autoreactive CD4+ T cells were polyclonal, targeted multiple epitopes, were restricted primarily by HLA-DR and did not cross-react with influenza antigens. Hypocretin-specific CD8+ T cells were also detected in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of several patients with narcolepsy.

Disease onset may occur at any age, although adolescents and young adults are mainly affected. Currently, the diagnosis delay ranges from 8 to 10 years and drug therapy may only attenuate symptoms. Pitolisant is a first-in-class new drug currently authorized by the European Medicines Agency to treat narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in adults and with an expanded evaluation for the treatment of neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of pitolisant, highlighting its effectiveness and safety in patients with narcolepsy. We performed a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar. We report on the efficacy and safety data of pitolisant in narcoleptic patients regarding cataplexy episodes and subjective and objective daytime sleepiness. The development program of pitolisant was characterized by eight Phase II/III studies. One proof-of-concept study followed by two pivotal studies, three randomized controlled trials, and two open studies were evaluated. Our review confirmed the effectiveness of pitolisant in treating major clinically relevant narcolepsy symptoms, including cataplexy, as compared to placebo. In addition, pitolisant revealed a safe profile when compared with placebo and active comparators. Headache, insomnia, and nausea were the prominent side effects. Further long-term randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of pitolisant with active comparators (ie, modafinil and sodium oxybate) may clarify its real place in therapy and its possible use as a first-line agent on the basis of its safety and tolerability.",2018.0
30190179,Clinical Characteristics and Burden of Illness in Pediatric Patients with Narcolepsy.,Plazzi G; Clawges HM; Owens JA,2018 Aug,Pediatric neurology,"Narcolepsy is a chronic and lifelong neurologic disorder with onset commonly occurring in childhood or adolescence, and affecting approximately 0.025% to 0.05% of the general population. The primary symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness, which is accompanied by cataplexy in 70% of patients. Other common symptoms include sleep paralysis, hallucinations upon falling asleep or waking, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. Narcolepsy is associated with a considerable burden of illness (BOI), which has been well characterized in adults, and is exacerbated by delays in symptom recognition, diagnosis, and intervention.

This review describes the specific characteristics and BOI of pediatric narcolepsy, using a wide range of published research data.

Pediatric narcolepsy presents distinct challenges in diagnosis and management. Narcolepsy symptoms often initially manifest differently in children and adolescents versus adults, which may pose diagnostic dilemmas. Children often respond to sleepiness with irritability, hyperactivity, and poor attention, which may be misinterpreted as misbehavior or neurocognitive sequelae of other conditions. Pediatric cataplexy symptoms may include subtle and unusual facial expressions or choreic-like movements, which are not observed in adults. Insufficient sleep and circadian rhythm disorders presenting with excessive daytime sleepiness are common in adolescents, potentially confounding narcolepsy diagnosis. Pediatric narcolepsy is also associated with comorbidities including rapid weight gain, precocious puberty, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and increased risk for deficits in social functioning, depression, and anxiety. School performance is also typically impaired, requiring special education services.

Thus, the discrete BOI of pediatric narcolepsy underscores the need for prompt and accurate diagnosis, and appropriate treatment of this disorder.",2018.0

We aimed to describe changes in HRQoL after two years of multidisciplinary follow-up in a cohort of mainly post-H1N1 vaccination narcolepsy type-1 (NT1) patients in Norway.

Prospective-cohort study. Narcolepsy diagnosis was based on the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (third edition). Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA). HRQoL was evaluated with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™ Generic Core Scales 4.0) at baseline and follow-up. Mean follow-up time was 20.7 (2.7) months.

Thirty one patients (18 females) with NT1, mean age 14.6 (SD = 4.8) years answered questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. On a group level, the PedsQL Total Health Summary score significantly improved by a mean of 5.9 (95%CI = 0.4, 11.9), p = 0.038; this was mainly driven by improvements in the Physical Health Summary score by 9.8 (3.0, 16.5) points, p = 0.006 and the School Functioning Scale score by 7.5 (1.0, 13.9) points p = 0.025.

NT1 was diagnosed according to the criteria of the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3).

Pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate.

Four months after initiation of methylphenidate therapy the increased daytime sleepiness improved and excessive weight gain stopped.

Diagnosis of NT1 can be challenging at disease onset and is often delayed, especially in the pediatric population, because symptoms usually evolve gradually. The case presented here raises the possibility that the HIV infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of NT1 serving as trigger for autoimmune-mediated destruction of hypocretin-secreting neurons.",2018.0

We sought to better define the epidemiology, etiology, and outcome of brain tumor-related narcolepsy.

We conducted an extensive review of the literature to identify cases of narcolepsy associated with brain tumors. Only cases of brain tumors involving the hypothalamic region including the suprasellar, sellar, and thalamus were included in this study.

We report a child with possible narcolepsy in a child with a brain tumor. Through our literature review, we identified 25 additional cases of narcolepsy associated with brain tumors affecting the hypothalamic area. Most symptomatic narcolepsy cases were reported in children (70%). Half of the patients (13 of 25, 52%) developed narcolepsy after surgery, whereas 11 patients (44%) were symptomatic at the time of the tumor diagnosis. Ten patients had narcolepsy without cataplexy. Most cases were associated with craniopharyngioma (38%), adenoma (24%), and glioma (14%). Three, including our patient, experienced a complete resolution of symptoms. All patients underwent biopsy and were treated with adjuvant therapy. For patients with persistent symptoms, most (60%) improved following medical management of narcolepsy.

Here, we report two children with narcolepsy presenting with cataplexy mimicking epileptic seizures as determined by long-term video-electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) monitoring. Case 1 was a 15-year-old girl presenting with recurrent episodes of ""convulsions"" and loss of consciousness, who was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of epilepsy showing ""convulsions"" and ""complex partial seizures"". The long-term video-polygraph showed a clonic attack lasting for 15 s, which corresponded to 1-2 Hz with interruption of mentalis EMG discharges lasting for 70-300 ms without any EEG changes. Narcolepsy was suspected due to the attack induced by hearty laughs and the presence of sleep attacks, and confirmed by low orexin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Case 2 was an 11-year-old girl presenting with recurrent episodes of myoclonic attacks simultaneously with dropping objects immediately after hearty laughs, in addition to sleep attacks, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The long-term video-polygraph showed a subtle attack, characterized by dropping chopsticks from her hand, which corresponded to an interruption of ongoing deltoid EMG discharges lasting 140 ms without any EEG changes. A diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by the low orexin levels in CSF. These cases demonstrate that children with narcolepsy may have attacks of cataplexy that resemble clonic or myoclonic seizures.",2018.0
29845680,Multiple sleep latency test in narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2: A 5-year follow-up study.,Huang YS; Guilleminault C; Lin CH; Chen CH; Chin WC; Chen TS,2018 Oct,Journal of sleep research,"Excessively sleepy teenagers and young adults without sleep-disordered breathing are diagnosed with either narcolepsy type 1 or narcolepsy type 2, or hypersomnia, based on the presence/absence of cataplexy and the results of a multiple sleep latency test. However, there is controversy surrounding this nomenclature. We will try to find the differences between different diagnoses of hypersomnia from the results of the long-term follow-up evaluation of a sleep study. We diagnosed teenagers who had developed excessive daytime sleepiness based on the criteria of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd edition. Each individual received the same clinical neurophysiologic testing every year for 5 years after the initial diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 (n = 111) or type 2 (n = 46). The follow-up evaluation demonstrated that narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy-cataplexy) is a well-defined clinical entity, with very reproducible clinical neurophysiologic findings over time, whereas patients with narcolepsy type 2 presented clear clinical and test variability. By the fifth year of the follow-up evaluation, 17.6% of subjects did not meet the diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy type 2, and 23.9% didn't show any two sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods in multiple sleep latency during the 5-year follow-up. Therefore narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy-cataplexy) is a well-defined syndrome, with the presentation clearly related to the known consequences of destruction of hypocretin/orexin neurons. Narcolepsy type 2 covers patients with clinical and test variability over time, thus bringing into question the usage of the term ""narcolepsy"" to label these patients.",2018.0

Method: Drug-free adult patients with ADHD (n = 100) or hypersomnia (n = 100) were evaluated using a structured clinical interview and self-report questionnaires on ADHD symptoms and EDS. Results: In all, 61% of patients with hypersomnia had clinically significant ADHD symptoms with 25% having an ADHD diagnosis (with both childhood and adulthood ADHD symptoms) and 36% ADHD-like symptoms, without history of childhood ADHD. EDS was reported in 47% of patients with ADHD, among whom 22% had a hypersomnolence disorder. Conclusion: We confirmed the high frequency of ADHD and ADHD-like symptoms in central hypersomnia, and of EDS and hypersomnolence in ADHD in adults. The nature of the link between EDS, inattention, and hyperactivity appears to be complex that may involve either a cause-effect relationship or intrinsic features of a similar neurodevelopmental dysfunction.",2020.0

29680434,Persistence of deep-tendon reflexes during partial cataplexy.,Barateau L; Pizza F; Lopez R; Antelmi E; Plazzi G; Dauvilliers Y,2018 May,Sleep medicine,"Deep-tendon reflexes are abolished during generalized cataplexy, but whether this is the case in partial cataplexy currently remains unknown. Partial cataplexy may mimic other neurologic/psychiatric phenomena, and knowledge of the reflexes status may provide information for differential diagnosis. We assessed whether deep-tendon reflexes are persistent during partial cataplexy.

Five drug-free patients with typical diagnoses of narcolepsy and clear-cut partial cataplexy were diagnosed in Reference Narcolepsy Centers in France and Italy. Biceps and patellar reflexes were elicited by physicians in charge and video-documented during cataplexy. Reflexes were assessed several times for each patient in different conditions and for various localizations of cataplexy.

The absence of tendon reflexes and complete loss of muscle tone during generalized cataplexy was confirmed, but the persistence of those reflexes during several partial cataplectic attacks at different ages, gender, localization of cataplexy (upper limbs, face) and reflexes (biceps, patellar) in drug-naive or withdrawal conditions was documented.

The persistence of tendon reflexes during several partial cataplexy episodes contrasts with their absence during generalized cataplexy. This discovery has clinical implications: the persistence of tendon reflexes does not rule out cataplexy diagnosis for partial attacks, whereas their transient abolishment or persistence during generalized attacks indicates cataplexy or pseudocataplexy, respectively.",2018.0
29609710,"Associations Between Neuropsychological, Neurobehavioral and Emotional Functioning and Either Narcolepsy or Idiopathic Hypersomnia in Children and Adolescents.",Ludwig B; Smith S; Heussler H,2018 Apr 15,Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,"Narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are chronic neurological sleep disorders characterized by hypersomnolence or excessive daytime sleepiness. This review aims to systematically examine the scientific literature on the associations between narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia and their effect on intellectual functioning, academic achievement, behavior, and emotion.

Published studies that examined those associations in children and adolescents were included. Studies in which children or adolescents received a clinical diagnosis, and in which the associated function was measured with at least one objective instrument were included. Twenty studies published between 1968 and 2017 were eligible for inclusion in this review.

There does not appear to be a clear association between intellectual functioning and narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia; however, limited research is an obstacle to obtaining generalizability. The variability in results from studies investigating associations between academic achievement and these two hypersomnolence disorders suggests that further research using standardized and validated assessment instruments is required to determine if there is an association. Behavior and emotion appear to be significantly affected by narcolepsy. Only two studies included populations of children and adolescents with idiopathic hypersomnia.

Further research using larger populations of children and adolescents with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia while utilizing standardized and validated instruments is required, because the effect of these conditions of hypersomnolence varies and is significant for each individual.",2018.0
29530376,A comparative study of methods for automatic detection of rapid eye movement abnormal muscular activity in narcolepsy.,Olesen AN; Cesari M; Christensen JAE; Sorensen HBD; Mignot E; Jennum P,2018 Apr,Sleep medicine,"To evaluate rapid eye movement (REM) muscular activity in narcolepsy by applying five algorithms to electromyogram (EMG) recordings, and to investigate its value for narcolepsy diagnosis.

A modified version of phasic EMG metric (mPEM), muscle activity index (MAI), REM atonia index (RAI), supra-threshold REM EMG activity metric (STREAM), and Frandsen method (FR) were calculated from polysomnography recordings of 20 healthy controls, 18 clinic controls (subjects suspected with narcolepsy but finally diagnosed without any sleep abnormality), 16 narcolepsy type one without REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), nine narcolepsy type one with RBD, and 18 narcolepsy type two. Diagnostic value of metrics in differentiating between groups was quantified by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Correlations among the metrics and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 (CSF-hcrt-1) values were calculated using linear models.

All metrics excluding STREAM found significantly higher muscular activity in narcolepsy one cases versus controls (p < 0.05). Moreover, RAI showed high sensitivity in the detection of RBD. The mPEM achieved the highest AUC in differentiating healthy controls from narcoleptic subjects. The RAI best differentiated between narcolepsy 1 and 2. Lower CSF-hcrt-1 values correlated with high muscular activity quantified by mPEM, sMAI, lMAI, PEM and FR (p < 0.05).

This automatic analysis showed higher number of muscle activations in narcolepsy 1 compared to controls. This finding might play a supportive role in diagnosing narcolepsy and in discriminating narcolepsy subtypes. Moreover, the negative correlation between CSF-hcrt-1 level and REM muscular activity supported a role for hypocretin in the control of motor tone during REM sleep.",2018.0

A 2000-2014 community-based narcolepsy cohort was identified in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Records were reviewed by a certified sleep specialist for accuracy of diagnosis, and comorbidities were extracted and analyzed. Comorbidities in narcolepsy subjects, both at diagnosis and upon follow-up, were compared with those in unaffected and age- and sex-matched cohort using conditional logistic regression.

At diagnosis, there was increased association of narcolepsy with anxiety (OR 4.56, 95% CI 1.99-10.44), thyroid disease (3.07, 1.19-7.90), hypertension (2.69, 1.22-5.93), and hyperlipidemia (2.49, 1.05-5.92). At the end of the prolonged observation period of 9.9 years (SD 7.27 years), there was increased association of narcolepsy with peripheral neuropathy (11.21, 1.16-108.11), non-migrainous headache (6.00, 1.73-20.83), glucose intolerance (2.39, 1.05-5.45), and automobile-related trauma (2.43, 1.08-5.45). Persistently increased both at diagnosis and after a prolonged observation period were associations of narcolepsy with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (69.25, 9.26-517.99 decreasing to 13.55, 5.08-36.14), chronic low back pain (5.46, 2.46-12.11 to 2.58, 1.39-4.77), depression (4.88, 2.45-9.73 to 3.79, 2.12-6.79), psychiatric disorders in general (4.73, 2.49-9.01 to 3.40, 1.94-5.98), endocrinopathies (4.15, 1.81-9.56 to 2.45, 1.33-4.49), and obesity (2.27, 1.13-4.56 to 2.07, 1.15-3.7).

In this community-based study of narcolepsy comorbidities, both at diagnosis and after prolonged follow-up, persistent comorbidities were revealed, including OSA, chronic low back pain, psychiatric disorders in general, endocrinopathies, and obesity.

29449194,Prostaglandin D2 Receptor DP1 Antibodies Predict Vaccine-induced and Spontaneous Narcolepsy Type 1: Large-scale Study of Antibody Profiling.,Sadam H; Pihlak A; Kivil A; Pihelgas S; Jaago M; Adler P; Vilo J; Vapalahti O; Neuman T; Lindholm D; Partinen M; Vaheri A; Palm K,2018 Mar,EBioMedicine,"Neuropathological findings support an autoimmune etiology as an underlying factor for loss of orexin-producing neurons in spontaneous narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy; sNT1) as well as in Pandemrix influenza vaccine-induced narcolepsy type 1 (Pdmx-NT1). The precise molecular target or antigens for the immune response have, however, remained elusive.

Here we have performed a comprehensive antigenic repertoire analysis of sera using the next-generation phage display method - mimotope variation analysis (MVA). Samples from 64 children and adolescents were analyzed: 10 with Pdmx-NT1, 6 with sNT1, 16 Pandemrix-vaccinated, 16 H1N1 infected, and 16 unvaccinated healthy individuals. The diagnosis of NT1 was defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine international criteria of sleep disorders v3.

Our data showed that although the immunoprofiles toward vaccination were generally similar in study groups, there were also striking differences in immunoprofiles between sNT1 and Pdmx-NT1 groups as compared with controls. Prominent immune response was observed to a peptide epitope derived from prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP1), as well as peptides homologous to B cell lymphoma 6 protein. Further validation confirmed that these can act as true antigenic targets in discriminating NT1 diseased along with a novel epitope of hemagglutinin of H1N1 to delineate exposure to H1N1.

We propose that DP1 is a novel molecular target of autoimmune response and presents a potential diagnostic biomarker for NT1. DP1 is involved in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and thus alterations in its functions could contribute to the disturbed sleep regulation in NT1 that warrants further studies. Together our results also show that MVA is a helpful method for finding novel peptide antigens to classify human autoimmune diseases, possibly facilitating the design of better therapies.",2018.0

We selected 30 video-recorded cataplexy and 21 pseudocataplexy attacks in 17 and 10 patients evaluated for suspected narcolepsy and with final diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 and conversion disorder, respectively, together with self-reported attacks features, and asked expert neurologists to blindly evaluate the motor features of the attacks. Video documented and self-reported attack features of cataplexy and pseudocataplexy were contrasted.

Video-recorded cataplexy can be positively differentiated from pseudocataplexy by the occurrence of facial hypotonia (ptosis, mouth opening, tongue protrusion) intermingled by jerks and grimaces abruptly interrupting laughter behavior (i.e. smile, facial expression) and postural control (head drops, trunk fall) under clear emotional trigger. Facial involvement is present in both partial and generalized cataplexy. Conversely, generalized pseudocataplexy is associated with persistence of deep tendon reflexes during the attack. Self-reported features confirmed the important role of positive emotions (laughter, telling a joke) in triggering the attacks, as well as the more frequent occurrence of partial body involvement in cataplexy compared with pseudocataplexy.

Cataplexy is characterized by abrupt facial involvement during laughter behavior. Video recording of suspected cataplexy attacks allows the identification of positive clinical signs useful for diagnosis and, possibly in the future, for severity assessment.",2018.0

Polysomnographic recordings from 61 controls, 46 children with RLS, and 44 children with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) were analyzed for total leg movements (LMS), PLMS, and isolated leg movements (ISOLMS) duration and indices, separately for school-age children and adolescents. Moreover, intermovement interval (IMI) graphs and time-of-night distribution of LMS were analyzed, and cut-off thresholds for PLMS index and total LMS index were assessed for the separation of RLS from controls.

All indices tended to decrease from school-age children to adolescents in normal controls and in NT1, whereas in RLS, only PLMS index increased. All school-age children had a similar IMI distribution with a single peak at IMI 2-4 s followed by gradual decline. In adolescents with RLS, a second peak at IMI 10-50 s was seen. Time-of-night distribution of most indices decreased in RLS, whereas most tended to increase in NT1. A PLMS index cutoff of 2 per hour best differentiated RLS from controls in school-age children (accuracy 70.0%) and in adolescents (accuracy 70.8%); however, most participants with NT1 also showed PLMS indices higher than this threshold.

PLMS index alone does not reliably predict the diagnosis of RLS in children and adolescents. However, analyses of IMI distribution and time-of-night distribution provide additional elements to support a diagnosis of RLS.",2018.0

Retrospective cohort study of children ages 6 to 18 years who completed a nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Our study sample included 11 patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), 6 with narcolepsy type 2 (NT2), 12 with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), and 11 with subjective hypersomnia (sHS). We compared group nRWA indices (epochs of RWA/total stage R sleep epochs) from the nocturnal PSGs and analyzed nRWA index receiver operating curve (ROC) statistics for narcolepsy diagnosis.

The median nRWA index of patients with NT1 was 15 to 30 times higher compared to sHS and IH (Ps < .005) but similar to that of the NT2 group (P = .46). RBD was present in 25% of patients with narcolepsy (NT1 and NT2). In comparing those with and without narcolepsy, the nRWA index area under the curve was 0.87 (0.6), 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75 to 0.99, P < .001. The threshold of having ≥ 1% of stage R sleep epochs with nRWA yielded a sensitivity of 88.2%, 95% CI = 63.6-98.5 and specificity of 60.9%, 95% CI = 38.5 to 80.3 for diagnosis of narcolepsy. In contrast, a threshold of ≥ 8% yielded a specificity of 95.7%, 95% CI = 78.1 to 99.9 and sensitivity of 52.9%, 95% CI = 27.8 to 77.

The nRWA index is a very good diagnostic biomarker of pediatric narcolepsy. Depending on the clinical cutoffs utilized, this biomarker can identify more children/adolescents with narcolepsy using just the PSG or reduce false-positive diagnostic results.",2018.0
29276000,A standardized test to document cataplexy.,Vandi S; Pizza F; Antelmi E; Neccia G; Iloti M; Mazzoni A; Avoni P; Plazzi G,2019 Jan,Sleep medicine,"Cataplexy is the pathognomonic symptom of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). Since it is considered difficult to be directly observed or documented by clinicians, its diagnosis relies mainly on history taking. Our study aimed at testing the feasibility of a standardized video recording procedure under emotional stimulation to document cataplexy in the diagnostic work-up of suspected hypersomnia of central origin.

Two-hundred-eight consecutive patients underwent the diagnostic work-up and reached the final diagnosis of NT1 (n = 133), idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy type 2 (IH/NT2 group, n = 33), or subjective excessive daytime sleepiness (sEDS group, n = 42). All subjects underwent a standardized video recording procedure while watching funny movies selected according to individual preferences, and a technician blind to clinical features reviewed the recordings to identify hypotonic phenomena that were finally confirmed by patients.

The video recording under emotional stimulation captured hypotonic phenomena in 72.2%, 9.1% and 4.8% of NT1, IH/NT2, and sEDS subjects (p < 0.0001), respectively. When tested against CSF hypocretin deficiency, the documentation of a hypotonic episode at the test showed an area under the ROC curve of 0.823 ± 0.033 (p < 0.0001). NT1 patients under anticataplectic medications showed less frequently hypotonic episodes than untreated ones (48.0% vs 77.8%, p = 0.003).

A standardized video recording procedure under emotional stimulation can help in the characterization of suspected hypersomnia of central origin.

This study's aims were to ascertain the demographics of stimulant medication users compared with non-users, examine temporal trends of stimulant medication use and estimate risk factors for development of amphetamine use disorder (AUD) and mortality among new users of stimulant medications.

Cox proportional hazards regression in a retrospective cohort adjusted by baseline covariates.

United States, national administrative database of the Veterans Affairs (VA) health-care system.

Adult incident users of stimulant medications (n = 78 829) from fiscal years (FY) 2001 to 2012.

Primary outcomes were time-to-event: (1) occurrence of AUD diagnosis and (2) death. Baseline covariates included demographic information, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for stimulant use, substance use disorders (SUD) and depression.

Stimulant users compared with non-users were younger, more likely to be non-Hispanic white and female. Incident stimulant medication users increased threefold from FY2001-FY2012 and eightfold among adults aged 18-44 years. Nearly one in 10 incident users in FY2012 had a comorbid baseline SUD. Off-label use was common-nearly three of every five incident users in FY2012. Comorbid SUDs among incident stimulant medication users were risk factors for occurrence of AUD during follow-up, with adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) estimates ranging from 1.54 to 2.83 (Ps < 0.05). Increased mortality risk was observed with occurrence of AUD during follow-up [AHR = 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-2.14, P = 0.007], while on-label prescribing was protective against death (AHR = 0.686, 95% CI = 0.63-0.75, P < 0.0001).

In a US national cohort of adult incident stimulant medication users in the Veterans Affairs health-care system, measured from fiscal years 2001 to 2012, comorbid substance use disorders were common and were risk factors for development of an amphetamine use disorder (AUD). Increased mortality risk among incident users of stimulant medications was observed among both those who developed an AUD later and those whose use was defined as off-label.",2018.0

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of narcolepsy in Catalunya (Catalonia), a north-east region of Spain (7 424 754 inhabitants), on 31 December 2014 by identifying all living subjects diagnosed with narcolepsy. First, we identified patients diagnosed by one of the 13 sleep, paediatric or neurological departments that perform tests regularly to diagnose narcolepsy. In a second phase, we searched for additional patients with narcolepsy in a clinical database of the primary health-care system. Clinical files were reviewed and narcolepsy diagnosis validated according to the Brighton Collaboration case definitions. Three hundred and twenty-five patients had a validated diagnosis of narcolepsy in the specialized centres (mean age: 44.6 years, range: 6-89; male: 60.3%; 85% with narcolepsy type 1), including 17.8% cases in Brighton, definition level 1, 62.5% in level 2, 15.4% in level 3 and 4.3% in level 4a.

Fifty-six additional narcoleptic patients were identified in the primary health-care system, increasing the overall prevalence to 5.2 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. Prevalence rates for narcolepsy type 1 increased from childhood to adulthood, but in subjects aged more than 50 years there was a substantial drop in prevalence rates, suggesting the presence of a significant pool of undiagnosed cases in this population.

Depression is a serious mood disorder that affects individuals' daily activities and functions. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between narcolepsy and depressive disorders.

The study consisted of patients diagnosed with narcolepsy between January 2002, and December 2011 (n = 258), and age-matched and gender-matched controls (n = 2580) from Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. Both the patients and the controls were monitored through December 31, 2011, to identify the occurrence of a depressive disorder. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the narcolepsy's potential influence on the comorbidity of a depressive disorder.

During the study period, 32.7%, 24.8%, and 10.9% of the narcoleptic patients were comorbid with any depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, and major depressive disorder, respectively. When compared to the control subjects, the patients with narcolepsy were at greater risks of having any depressive disorder (aOR 6.77; 95% CI 4.90-9.37), dysthymic disorder (aOR 6.62; 95% CI 4.61-9.57), and major depressive disorder (aOR 6.83; 95% CI 4.06-11.48). Of the narcoleptic patients that were comorbid with depression, >50% had been diagnosed with depression prior to being diagnosed with narcolepsy.

This nationwide data study revealed that narcolepsy and depression commonly co-occurred. Since some symptoms of narcolepsy overlapped with those of depressive disorders, the findings serve as a reminder that clinicians must pay attention to the comorbidity of narcolepsy and depression.",2017.0

Several studies demonstrated its association with HLA-DQB1*0602 in various ethnic groups. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of HLA-DQB1*0602 allele in Iranian patients with narcolepsy and assess its predictive parameters for diagnosing narcolepsy. In addition, car accidents and job problems were assessed among narcoleptic patients. We studied 44 narcoleptic patients, 30 patients with other types of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)  and 50 healthy age and sex matched individuals in this case-control study. Patients and controls filled out a questionnaire including items about car accidents due to sleepiness and job problems. International classification of sleep disorders-2 criteria was used as the gold standard for diagnosis of narcolepsy. The DNAs isolated from whole blood samples were collected from the patients and controls to assess the presence of HLA-DQB1*0602. The results showed that HLA DQB1*0602 was present in 4 (8%) individual of controls and 20 (45.5%) patients with higher prevalence in patients with cataplexy (78.9%) than patients without cataplexy (p<0.001). The sensitivities of the DQB1*0602 for diagnosing narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy were 78.9 and 20; specificities were 88 and 72.4, respectively. 18.2% of patients had car accidents due to sleepiness and 68.2% suffered from job problems. Our study shows that evaluation of DQB1*0602 in patients suspected to narcolepsy could be helpful especially in complex cases with atypical cataplexy and indistinguishable multiple sleep latency test MSLT results. Moreover, high rates of car accidents and job problems are found among narcoleptic patients.",2017.0

With emerging attention to the long-term course of the disorder and importance of accurate diagnosis, the diagnostic stability of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)-the mostly frequently used test to identify narcolepsy-is often challenged.

In this study, we compared the baseline and follow-up demographic characteristics and body mass index (BMI) of patients with narcolepsy type 1. Moreover, MSLT results from repeated tests conducted on 48 patients with narcolepsy type 1 were compared, with mean follow-up of approximately 10 years.

BMI from the baseline to the follow-up visit was significantly increased in the participants. There were no significantly different parameter changes in MSLT results.

MSLT has good test-retest validity in patients with narcolepsy type 1. Close surveillance for the detection and management of obesity is warranted in clinical settings.",2017.0

The transient nature of the event can make diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) difficult, as symptoms have often resolved by time of initial presentation. The symptoms and presentation of syncope are similar to many other conditions, which can lead to difficulty in establishing a diagnosis in the ED.

This review evaluates patients presenting with a history concerning for possible syncope, mimics of syncope, and approach to managing syncope mimics.

Syncope is caused by transient LOC secondary to global cerebral hypoperfusion. Many conditions can present similarly to syncope, making diagnosis in the ED difficult. Some of the most emergent conditions include seizures, stroke, metabolic disorders, and head trauma. Other nonemergent conditions include cataplexy, pseudosyncope, or deconditioning. Many laboratory studies and imaging can be nondiagnostic during ED evaluation. For patients presenting with apparent syncope, immediate treatment should focus on identifying and treating life-threatening conditions. History and physical examination can help guide further diagnostic evaluation and management.

Patients with apparent syncope should be evaluated for potential immediate life-threatening conditions. A thorough history and physical examination can aid in distinguishing syncope from common mimics and help identify and subsequently treat life-threatening conditions.",2018.0

PSG-MSLT in drug-free conditions was administered twice (median interval of 1.9 years) in 22 patients with NT1 (10 males, median age 31.2 years) and 75 patients with NCHS (32 males, median age 25.7 years).

At the first PSG-MSLT, patients with NCHS were classified as having NT2 (22.7%), IH (26.7%), or UnsEDS (50.6%). A positive PSG-MSLT was confirmed in 72.7% of NT1. The classification consistency at retesting was significantly lower for the NT2 (47.1%), IH (25.0%), and UnsEDS (42.1%) categories than NT1 (81.3%). The between-test mean sleep latency (MSL) variability was significantly different in NT1 and NCHS, with higher changes in NT2 and lower in NT1. A longer test-retest interval was associated with improved MSL and MSLT normalization. Between-test variations in SOREMP number were associated with changes in nocturnal REM sleep parameters and MSL. No association was found with the clinical decision to repeat the evaluation or the disease clinical course.

The PSG-MSLT measures and classification are not stable in patients with NCHS, with frequent diagnostic changes, particularly for NT2 and IH, compared with NT1. MSLT needs to be repeated at regular intervals to confirm a stable hypersomnia and provide an accurate diagnosis of NT2 and IH.",2017.0

This study reviews the sleep disorders found in patients with narcolepsy, the prevalence of SAHS associated with these patients and their response to the different treatments.

We conducted an observation-based retrospective descriptive analysis of 25 patients diagnosed with narcolepsy, who were treated in our centre between October 2012 and December 2016.

Of 470 patients evaluated in the specialised neurology consultation unit, 25 patients were diagnosed with narcolepsy (5.31%); 65% were males and the remaining 35% were females; the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 40 years. 60% presented other associated sleep disorders, the most frequent being SAHS (36%). The efficacy rate of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is 66% in patients with SAHS with an indication of CPAP.

Altogether, 60% of patients with narcolepsy have a second associated sleep disorder (greater than the incidence of coexistence in the general population, of 20-25% of patients), and those reported are also the most frequent among the general population (SAHS, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder). 36% of patients with narcolepsy have SAHS as an associated condition.

Between February 2002 and June 2015, 622 pediatric patients with EDS were evaluated with overnight PSG and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test at the Samsung Medical Center. The medical records; questionnaire responses about depression, sleepiness, sleep habits; and sleep study data of 133 patients without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were reviewed retrospectively.

The patients (63 girls, 70 boys) slept for an average of 7 h 30 min and 8 h 44 min on weekdays and weekends, respectively. The mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 11.01 ± 4.09 and did not differ significantly among sleep disorders. Among the 102 patients who completed the depression questionnaire, 53 showed depressive feelings, which were moderate or severe in 39, with no significant differences among specific sleep disorders. Thirty-four patients exhibited normal PSG results. Seventeen of them were concluded as not having any sleep disorders, and the others as having delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD). Narcolepsy (n = 78) was the most common disorder, followed by DSPD (n = 17) and idiopathic hypersomnia (n = 12).

Pediatric patients with EDS had various sleep disorders and some did not have any sleep disorder despite EDS. More than half the patients with EDS showed depressive feelings affecting their daily lives. For pediatric patients with EDS, a systematic diagnostic approach including questionnaires for sleep habits and emotion and PSG is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment.",2017.0

EDS presents in 100% of patients with narcolepsy; it is usually the first and the most disabling symptom, which varies in aspects, such as onset age, severity, and clinical characteristics. Early recognition of this symptom leads to early diagnosis and intervention. A diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on clarifying EDS through history, subjective evaluation using questionnaires, and objective measurement, including nocturnal polysomnography followed by a daytime multiple sleep latency test.

28777172,Narcolepsy and Other Central Hypersomnias.,Dauvilliers Y; Barateau L,2017 Aug,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)","This article focuses on the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2, idiopathic hypersomnia, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and other central disorders of hypersomnolence, as defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3).

In ICSD-3, the names of some central disorders of hypersomnolence have been changed: narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy have been renamed narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2, respectively. A low level of hypocretin-1/orexin-A in the CSF is now theoretically sufficient to diagnose narcolepsy type 1, as it is a highly specific and sensitive biomarker. Conversely, other central hypersomnias are less well-defined disorders with variability in the phenotype, and few reliable biomarkers have been discovered so far. The epidemiologic observation that influenza A (H1N1) infection and vaccination are potential triggering factors of narcolepsy type 1 (discovered during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic) has increased interest in this rare disease, and progress is being made to better understand the process (highly suspected to be autoimmune) responsible for the destruction of hypocretin neurons. Treatment of narcolepsy remains largely symptomatic, usually initially with modafinil or armodafinil or with higher-potency stimulants such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. Several newer wake-promoting agents and psychostimulants have also been developed, including sodium oxybate, which has a role in the treatment of cataplexy and as an adjunctive wake-promoting agent, and pitolisant, a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist that is currently only available in Europe.

Although far less common than many other sleep disorders, central hypersomnias are among the most severe and disabling diseases in the field of sleep medicine, and their early recognition is of major importance for patients, especially children, to maximize their quality of life and functioning in activities of daily living.",2017.0
28777171,Diagnostic Approach and Investigation in Sleep Medicine.,Silber MH,2017 Aug,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)","This article provides a clinical approach to the appropriate investigation and diagnosis of sleep disorders commonly seen by neurologists.

Home sleep apnea testing in appropriate situations can replace laboratory polysomnography in many cases of uncomplicated sleep apnea. Multiple sleep latency tests must be performed meticulously and interpreted in the clinical setting to avoid overdiagnoses of narcolepsy. Human leukocyte antigen testing has limited utility in establishing a diagnosis of narcolepsy because a positive test has low specificity. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is frequently the first manifestation of an evolving synucleinopathy, and a careful history and neurologic examination are needed to determine other early features of these disorders.

A meticulous history from the patient, supplemented by collateral history from an observer, is essential to establishing the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Judicious supplementary use of investigations, such as laboratory polysomnography, home sleep apnea testing, wrist actigraphy, and multiple sleep latency tests, can confirm the correct diagnosis. This article describes an approach to the sleepy patient, the patient with neuromuscular disease and possible sleep-disordered breathing, the patient with restless legs syndrome, and young and older patients with abnormal movements during sleep.",2017.0

From the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR), 1174 patients (45.1% males) aged 20-59 years and 339 patients (44.8% males) aged 60+ who received a diagnosis of narcolepsy between 1998 and 2014 were compared, respectively, with 4716 and 1353 control citizens matched for age, gender and geography, who were randomly chosen from the Danish Civil Registration System Statistics. In the NPR, all morbidities are grouped into major WHO classes.

Middle-aged and elderly patients had more health contacts before and after their narcolepsy diagnosis with respect to several disease domains: infections, neoplasm, endocrine/metabolic diseases/diabetes, mental/psychiatric, neurological (including epilepsy), eye, cardiovascular (hypertension, ischemic heart disease), respiratory (upper-airway infections, sleep apnea), gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal (including discopathies) and skin diseases. Narcolepsy patients had lower reproductive rates. Furthermore, patients showed significantly more health contacts due to the evaluation and control contacts for disease and symptoms. Patients suffered from significantly more multiple diseases than did controls. The 17-year hazard ratio mortality rates were 1.35 (95% CI, 0.94-1.95, p = 0.106) among 20-59 year-olds, and 1.38 (1.12-1.69, p = 0.002) among those aged 60+ years.

This was a retrospective medical claims data analysis. Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Research Databases were accessed to identify individuals ≥18 years of age with ≥1 diagnosis code for narcolepsy (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, 347.0, 347.00, 347.01, 347.1, 347.10, or 347.11) continuously insured between 2006 and 2010, and controls without narcolepsy matched 5:1 on age, gender, region, and payer. Narcolepsy and control subjects were compared for frequency of comorbid conditions, identified by the appearance of >1 diagnosis code(s) mapped to a Clinical Classification System (CCS) level 1 category any time during the study period, and on specific subcategories, including recognized narcolepsy comorbidities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and depression.

The final study group included 9312 subjects with narcolepsy and 46,559 controls (each group: average age, 46.1 years; 59% female). As compared with controls, patients with narcolepsy showed a statistically significant excess prevalence in all the CCS multilevel categories, the only exceptions being conditions originating in the perinatal period and pregnancy/childbirth complications. The greatest excess prevalence in the narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1% excess prevalence; odds ratio (OR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of the digestive system (21.4% excess prevalence; OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5, 2.8) and nervous system/sense organs (excluding narcolepsy; 20.7% excess prevalence; OR 3.7, 95% CI 3.4, 3.9).

However, there are no formal guidelines regarding the use of neuroimaging to identify such secondary causes of symptoms. We sought to characterize brain MRI findings in a series of patients with idiopathic hypersomnia.

We reviewed medical records on a consecutive series of 61 patients diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia to determine the frequency and results of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

One-third of patients had undergone brain MRI, with focal neurologic signs or symptoms being the most common indication for neuroimaging. Although seven patients had an identifiable finding on neuroimaging (e.g., chronic microvascular ischemic changes), clinical management was changed as a result of imaging in only three cases. In all three, the imaging finding was predated by clear clinical abnormalities.

Neuroimaging may be a complementary part of an idiopathic hypersomnia evaluation, but the decision to pursue imaging should be made on a case-by-case basis.",2017.0
28366327,Underutilization of the MSLT in sleepy patients with a short onset REM period (SOREMP) in the sleep clinic.,Cairns A; Bogan R,2017 Apr,Sleep medicine,"A nocturnal sleep onset REM period (defined as REM onset latency ≤ 15 min; SOREMP) occurs rarely and research has shown that the phenomenon is specific for type 1 and 2 narcolepsy. However, little is known about the meaningfulness of the phenotype in general sleep clinic patients because those that exhibit the phenomenon often present with few traditional narcolepsy symptoms. As such, this study aimed to (1) evaluate the rate of eventual MSLT testing for those with a SOREMP on routine PSG when the phenomenon occurred in the absence of potential explanatory factors and (2) quantify the stability of the SOREMP phenotype.

This was a retrospective analysis of a large repository of de-identified PSG and MSLT test results from 2008 to 2015. Patient records were retrieved from a repository of studies completed at a variety of sleep laboratories across the USA. A total of 118,046 baseline polysomnograms were evaluated for a PSG SOREMP (occurred in 0.7% of the sample). Patients were excluded if they indicated working either shift or night work at the time of the SOREMP or if their self-reported habitual weekday time in bed was less than 7 h. A final sample of 391 cases with a SOREMP were sequestered and previous or consecutive studies were searched for each individual.

The vast majority of patients (n = 347/391; 89%) with a PSG SOREMP never received MSLT testing. Patients that were evaluated by MSLT (n = 44; 11%) were typically very sleepy and 82% ended up with a diagnosis of narcolepsy or had MSLTs consistent with current narcolepsy criteria (ie, including the nocturnal SOREMP). Only seven of the 140 patients (n = 5%) that with OSA that first underwent one or more PAP titrations were subsequently seen for an MSLT. Compared to those that eventually received an MSLT, patients that did not receive MSLT testing were older (52 vs. 41 years, p < 0.001), more likely to have moderate to severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15; 39% vs. 16%, p < 0.001), and were generally less likely to report severe sleepiness (ESS ≥ 16; 25% vs. 55%, p < 0.001) and vehicle or workplace accidents or injuries. However, 12% of those that never received an MSLT reported such extreme sleepiness that they endorsed a near-miss car accident due to sleepiness, almost twice as prevalent than that found in a random sample of matched moderate-to-severe OSA patients (p < 0.01). Overall, the reliability of the SOREMP phenotype was low at 9.8%, but was much higher for those diagnosed with type 2 narcolepsy (31%) compared to those without narcolepsy (IH or normal MSLTs; 0%; p < 0.01) or where narcolepsy status was unknown because an MSLT was not conducted (7%; p < 0.01).

The MSLT has been historically underutilized for those exhibiting a SOREMP on diagnostic PSG, a potential marker of narcolepsy. This is presumably because patients with a PSG SOREMP reported variable levels of sleepiness (although some severe) and many had some degree of OSA, which may either be a partial factor in symptomology or even obscure true narcolepsy. Some patients with a PSG SOREMP were very sleepy and most, when an MSLT was conducted, received a diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy despite few presenting with some of the associated features of narcolepsy. Well-controlled longitudinal studies with high quality data on cataplexy and hypocretin status are needed to understand where the PSG SOREMP phenomenon falls on the hypersomnolence spectrum and to establish which comorbidities share variance with and/or potentially mask narcolepsy. However because untreated narcolepsy can have high social, functional, and financial burden, until such studies are done, physicians should consider a narcolepsy workup when a SOREMP is observed (especially if multiple are seen) as well as close follow-up for symptom resolution when, for example, a patient is treated for sleep apnea.",2017.0

We hypothesized that sleep stage dissociations can be objectively detected through the analysis of nocturnal Polysomnography (PSG) data, and that those affecting REM sleep can be used as a diagnostic feature for narcolepsy.

A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model using 38 features extracted from EOG, EMG and EEG was used in control subjects to select features differentiating wake, stage N1, N2, N3 and REM sleep. Sleep stage differentiation was next represented in a 2D projection. Features characteristic of sleep stage differences were estimated from the residual sleep stage probability in the 2D space. Using this model we evaluated PSG data from NT1 and non-narcoleptic subjects. An LDA classifier was used to determine the best separation plane.

This method replicates the specificity/sensitivity from the training set to the validation set better than many other methods.

Eight prominent features could differentiate narcolepsy and controls in the validation dataset. Using a composite measure and a specificity cut off 95% in the training dataset, sensitivity was 43%. Specificity/sensitivity was 94%/38% in the validation set. Using hypersomnia subjects, specificity/sensitivity was 84%/15%. Analyzing treated narcoleptics the specificity/sensitivity was 94%/10%.

Disease primers,"Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that has a typical onset in adolescence and is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, which can have severe consequences for the patient. Problems faced by patients with narcolepsy include social stigma associated with this disease, difficulties in obtaining an education and keeping a job, a reduced quality of life and socioeconomic consequences. Two subtypes of narcolepsy have been described (narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2), both of which have similar clinical profiles, except for the presence of cataplexy, which occurs only in patients with narcolepsy type 1. The pathogenesis of narcolepsy type 1 is hypothesized to be the autoimmune destruction of the hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus; this hypothesis is supported by immune-related genetic and environmental factors associated with the disease. However, direct evidence in support of the autoimmune hypothesis is currently unavailable. Diagnosis of narcolepsy encompasses clinical, electrophysiological and biological evaluations, but simpler and faster procedures are needed. Several medications are available for the symptomatic treatment of narcolepsy, all of which have quite good efficacy and safety profiles. However, to date, no treatment hinders or slows disease development. Improved diagnostic tools and increased understanding of the pathogenesis of narcolepsy type 1 are needed and might lead to therapeutic or even preventative interventions.",2017.0

Ideally, screening and diagnosis instruments that assist physicians in evaluating a patient for type 1 or type 2 narcolepsy would be brief, easy for patients to understand and physicians to score, and would identify or rule out the need for electrophysiological testing.

A search of the literature was conducted to review patient-reported measures used for the assessment of narcolepsy, mainly in clinical trials, with the goal of summarizing existing scales and identifying areas that may require additional screening questions and clinical practice scales.

Of the seven scales reviewed, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale continues to be an important outcome measure to screen adults for excessive daytime sleepiness, which may be associated with narcolepsy. Several narcolepsy-specific scales have demonstrated utility, such as the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale, Swiss Narcolepsy Scale, and Narcolepsy Symptom Assessment Questionnaire, but further validation is required.

Although the narcolepsy-specific scales currently in use may identify type 1 narcolepsy, there are no validated questionnaires to identify type 2 narcolepsy.

To unravel the autoimmune processes across diseases, comprehensive and unbiased analyses of proteins targets recognized by the adaptive immune system are needed. Here we present an approach starting from high-density peptide arrays to characterize autoantibody repertoires and to identify new autoantigens. A set of ten plasma and serum samples from subjects with multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, and without any disease diagnosis were profiled on a peptide array representing the whole proteome, hosting 2.2 million 12-mer peptides with a six amino acid lateral shift. On the basis of the IgG reactivities found on these whole-proteome peptide microarrays, a set of 23 samples was then studied on a targeted array with 174 000 12-mer peptides of single amino acid lateral shift. Finally, verification of IgG reactivities was conducted with a larger sample set (n = 448) using the bead-based peptide microarrays. The presented workflow employed three different peptide microarray formats to discover and resolve the epitopes of human autoantibodies and revealed two potentially new autoantigens: MAP3K7 in multiple sclerosis and NRXN1 in narcolepsy. The presented strategy provides insights into antibody repertoire reactivity at a peptide level and may accelerate the discovery and validation of autoantigens in human diseases.",2017.0
28065388,A systematic review of cognitive function and psychosocial well-being in school-age children with narcolepsy.,Blackwell JE; Alammar HA; Weighall AR; Kellar I; Nash HM,2017 Aug,Sleep medicine reviews,"In August 2010, concerns were raised about an increase in the incidence rate of narcolepsy diagnosis in children and adolescents. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological sleep disorder characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness and attacks of muscle weakness which are often precipitated by strong emotions, known as cataplexy. We systematically examined and updated the scientific literature on the consequences of narcolepsy on cognitive function and psychosocial well-being in school-age children. Eight studies published between 2005 and 2015 were eligible for inclusion in this review. Collectively the results provide evidence to suggest that children who develop narcolepsy are at significant risk of cognitive impairment in at least one domain and emotional problems including depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. Children with narcolepsy should be monitored carefully in order to manage and reduce the impact of any impairments present. The existing literature is limited by small sample sizes, lack of appropriate controls and lack of longitudinal data. Future research should aim to address the limitations of the current work and aim to determine the underlying cause of cognitive and psychological impairments. This will enable the design of effective interventions to support children with narcolepsy so that they are able to achieve their full potential.",2017.0

Investigate the effect of pediatric onset of narcolepsy symptoms on time to diagnosis of narcolepsy and presence of comorbid depression.

Cross-sectional survey of 1,699 people in the United States with self-reported diagnosis of narcolepsy. We utilized mixed-methods data analyses to report study findings.

Most participants reported receiving a diagnosis of narcolepsy more than 1 y after symptom onset. We found that the strongest predictor of this delayed diagnosis was pediatric onset of symptoms (odds ratio = 2.4, p < 0.0005). Depression was the most common comorbidity but we detected no association with pediatric onset of narcolepsy symptoms. Overall, participants reported that fatigue and cognitive difficulties were their most burdensome symptoms in addition to sleepiness and cataplexy. The majority of participants reported residual daytime fatigue and/or sleepiness despite treatment. Most participants reported they could not perform at work or school as well as they would like because of narcolepsy symptoms.

This study provides unique insight into the narcolepsy disease experience. The study quantifies the problem of diagnostic delay for narcolepsy patients in the United States and highlights that symptoms are more likely to be missed if they develop before 18 y of age. These results suggest that narcolepsy awareness efforts should be aimed at parents, pediatric health care providers, school professionals, and children/adolescents themselves. Disease burden is high because of problems with fatigue, cognition, and persistence of residual symptoms despite treatment.",2017.0

ADCA-DN is also associated with sensorimotor polyneuropathy, extrapyramidal, and dysautonomic signs, as well as dementia. Little has been reported about the progressive cognitive impairment associated with ADCA-DN. Our objective is to provide a detailed characterization of the cognitive profile of ADCA-DN.

Three members of a kindred with ADCA-DN underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging.

At baseline, 2 individuals demonstrated cognitive profiles with executive difficulties in some areas consistent with frontal-system dysfunction behaviorally and on standardized testing. The third individual was further in the disease course and exhibited more globally impaired cognition consistent with a diagnosis of dementia.

This family demonstrated progressive neurodegeneration beginning with isolated areas of executive dysfunction and leading to globally impaired cognition and dementia. Cognitive decline occurred in parallel with neurological deterioration. The cognitive profile is similar to case reports of other individuals with an allelic neurological phenotype, Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathy 1E, also caused by DNMT1 mutations.

Type 1 and type 2 Narcolepsy: Investigations and follow-up.,Monaca C; Franco P; Philip P; Dauvilliers Y,2017 Jan-Feb,Revue neurologique,"In the new international classification of sleep disorders (ICSD-3), narcolepsy is differentiated into two distinct pathologies: type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) and type 2 narcolepsy (NT2). NT1 is characterised by periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotion) and in some cases the presence of symptoms such as hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and disturbed night-time sleep. Its physiopathology is based on the loss of hypocretin neurons in the hypothalamus, seemingly connected to an auto-immune process. By definition, cataplexy is absent and the hypocretin levels in the CSF are normal in NT2. Confirming the diagnosis requires polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests. The choice of further investigations is based on the presence or absence of typical cataplexy. Further investigations include HLA typing, lumbar puncture to measure the hypocretin level in the CSF, or even brain imagery in the case of narcolepsy suspected to be secondary to an underlying pathology. In this consensus we propose recommendations for the work-up to be carried out during diagnosis and follow-up for patients suffering from narcolepsy.",2017.0

Extensive subanalyses were conducted to confirm the validity of narcolepsy definitions. Narcolepsy subjects and controls were compared for frequency of psychiatric comorbid conditions (based on ICD-9 codes/Clinical Classification Software [CCS] level 2 categories) and psychiatric medication use.

The final population included 9,312 narcolepsy subjects and 46,559 controls (each group, mean age = 46.1 years; 59% female). All categories of mental illness were significantly more prevalent in patients with narcolepsy versus controls, with the highest excess prevalence noted for CCS 5.8 Mood disorders (37.9% vs 13.8%; odds ratio [OR] = 4.0; 95% CI, 3.8-4.2), CCS 5.8.2 Depressive disorders (35.8% vs 13.0%; OR = 3.9; 95% CI, 3.7-4.1), and CCS 5.2 Anxiety disorders (25.1% vs 11.9%; OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 2.4-2.7). Excess prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders (narcolepsy vs controls) was higher in younger age groups versus older age groups. Psychiatric medication usage was higher in the narcolepsy group versus controls in the following categories: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (36% vs 17%), anxiolytic benzodiazepines (34% vs 19%), hypnotics (29% vs 13%), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (21% vs 6%), and tricyclic antidepressants (13% vs 4%) (all P values < .0001).

To ascertain whether the influence of the altered architecture of sleep in patients with narcolepsy type 1 (ie, with cataplexy: NT1) also varies with age, we compared the performance values of 16 children (aged from nine to 14 years) and 16 adults (aged from 24 to 51 years) on finger tapping task (FTT) after daytime and nighttime periods of sleep in the 24 hours following training.

All patients, who were drug-free and underwent continuous polysomnographic recordings, could take one or more naps after the training session (at 10 a.m.) until one hour before the first retrieval session (at 6 p.m.) and had an undisturbed period of nighttime sleep from about 10 p.m. to two hours before the second retrieval session (again at 10 a.m.).

The pattern of sleep-dependent consolidation was significantly different in the two groups of patients: while performance accuracy was higher in adults compared with children at each session, performance speed improved after daytime sleep in children and after nighttime sleep in adults. The improvement in performance speed, although not related with any sleep parameters in both groups, was positively correlated with the daytime and nighttime total sleep time (TST) in children with greater consolidation gain.

The interaction between time of day and age in the time course of consolidation of new motor skills discloses a different role of daytime sleep (active in children, simply protective from interferences in adults) in NT1 patients and suggests a flexible use of napping in the educational context.",2016.0

Polysomnography data, including shifts to Stage N1/Wake, were from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of sodium oxybate. Patients were ≥16 years old with a diagnosis of narcolepsy including symptoms of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness. Treatment was for 8 weeks with placebo or sodium oxybate 4.5, 6 or 9 g administered as two equally divided nightly doses. Relative to baseline, significant dose-dependent reductions in the number of shifts per hour from Stages N2/3/rapid eye movement and Stages N2/3 to Stage N1/Wake were observed at week 8 with sodium oxybate (P < 0.05); sodium oxybate 6- and 9-g doses also resulted in similar reductions in shifts per hour of rapid eye movement to Stage N1/Wake (both P < 0.05). Across all shift categories, the shift reductions with sodium oxybate 9 g were significantly greater than those observed with placebo (P < 0.05). Improvements from baseline in reported sleep quality were significantly greater with sodium oxybate 4.5 and 9 g at week 8 (P < 0.05).

However, there is limited data on the epidemiology of narcolepsy, particularly in the adult population. Therefore, we sought to examine narcolepsy incidence rates in the United States and describe associated characteristics. We performed a population based epidemiologic study of active duty military personnel. All outpatient clinics in the continental United States providing care for active duty military between 2004 through 2013 were included utilizing existing databases. Narcolepsy was defined in 3 ways: (1) 2 diagnoses of narcolepsy within 6months of each other, one made by a sleep expert; (2) 2 diagnoses by any provider followed by a narcolepsy prescription within 14days of last visit; and (3) procedure code for a sleep study followed by a narcolepsy diagnosis by a sleep expert within 6months. There were 1675 narcolepsy cases. Overall incidence of narcolepsy trended from 14.6 to 27.3 cases per 100,000 person-years, with an increase starting after 2005-2006 and peaking during the 2011-2012 influenza season. Higher frequencies were seen among females, non-Hispanic blacks, and members living in the south. Narcolepsy incidence rates among active duty military members are higher than previously described. The reason for the steady rise of incidence from 2005 to 2006 through 2011-2012 is unknown; however, these findings require further exploration.

New measurements at 1-y reassessment in patients undergoing different treatments were compared with baseline data.

We detected a high prevalence of overweight (29.2%), obesity (25%), metabolic syndrome (18.8%), and precocious puberty (16.1%), but no signs of linear growth alterations at diagnosis. According to anthropometric records, weight gain started soon after NT1 onset. At 1-y follow-up reassessment, sodium oxybate treatment was associated with a significant BMI z-score reduction (-1.29 ± 0.30, p < 0.0005) after adjusting for baseline age, sex, sleepiness, and BMI.

It is one of the most important causes of excessive daytime sleepiness in the pediatric population. The aim of this study is to present the clinical and laboratory findings, and treatment results of pediatric patients with narcolepsy. Materials and Methods We studied five unrelated consecutive children with narcolepsy, focusing on clinical and laboratory features, the therapy and outcome over the 33-month follow-up period. Results The study subjects included two boys and three girls. The mean age at diagnosis was 11.8 ± 3.3 years (range: 8-16 years). Three patients had cataplexy. There were no hypnagogic hallucinations and/or sleep paralysis in any patients. All patients were educated about sleep hygiene, appropriate nutrition, and regular exercise. Three patients were treated with modafinil, while two patients received methylphenidate. Sodium oxybate was added to existing treatment in patients with cataplexy. Cataplexy attacks did not respond well to the treatment in one patient; therefore intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was given. Conclusions Early diagnosis is important to help narcoleptic patients in improving their quality of life.

Other less consistent symptoms include hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, disturbed nighttime sleep, and weight gain. Narcolepsy with cataplexy remains a clinical diagnosis but nighttime and daytime polysomnography (multiple sleep latency tests) are useful to document mean sleep latency below 8 min and at least two sleep-onset REM periods. HLA typing shows an association with HLA DQB1*0602 in more than 92% of cases but was not included in the new diagnostic criteria. In contrast, a low hypocretin-1/orexin-A levels (values below 110 pg/mL) in the cerebrospinal fluid was highly specific for narcolepsy with cataplexy and was included in the recent diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy. The deficiency of the hypocretin system is well-established in human narcoleptics with a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin levels in relation with an early loss of hypocretin neurons.

Narcolepsy is uncommon, with a low prevalence rate which makes it difficult to diagnose definitively without a complex series of tests and a detailed history. The aim of this study was to review patients referred to a tertiary sleep centre who had been labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy prior to referral in order to assess if the diagnosis was accurate, and if not, to determine the cause of diagnostic misattribution.

All patients seen at a sleep centre from 2007-2013 (n = 551) who underwent detailed objective testing including an MSLT PSG, as well as wearing an actigraphy watch and completing a sleep diary for 2 weeks, were assessed for a pre-referral and final diagnosis of narcolepsy.

The diagnosis can be confirmed by objective measures, such as typical findings in the multiple sleep latency test, reduced or undetectable levels of orexin (hypocretin) in the cerebrospinal fluid, and linkage to a specific HLA haplotype. Nevertheless, the mean time that elapses from symptom onset to the correct diagnosis ranges between 10 and 20 years, and the causes and correlates of this delay are poorly understood. Diagnostic delay was assessed on 52 well-defined patients with narcolepsy type 1, evaluating clinical, electrophysiological and neurochemical parameters and the results of a 41-item questionnaire developed to obtain the patients' perspective on various aspects of the diagnostic process. The mean time gap between disease onset and first medical consultation was 3.2 ± 5.1 years; the mean diagnostic delay was 8.9 ± 11.0 years. Prior to correct diagnosis, patients received a wide variety of misdiagnoses. The self-ratings of the patients revealed that the undiagnosed symptoms caused high levels of anxiety and unjustified criticism by family, friends and employers. Multiple regression analysis identified higher cerebrospinal fluid orexin levels (β = 0.311, P = 0.01), and a longer interval between the onset of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy (β = 0.368, P = 0.002) as independent associates of longer diagnostic delay. The diagnostic delay decreased over the last decades (β = -0.672, P < 0.001).

We estimated the frequency of psychosis and its characteristics in NT1 at two European sleep centers (France, n = 381; Spain, n = 161) and measured IgG autoantibodies that recognize the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR in 9 patients with NT1 with psychosis, and 25 NT1 patients without psychosis. Ten NT1 patients (6 in France, 4 in Spain) were diagnosed with comorbid psychosis, a frequency of 1.8%. One patient reported psychotic symptoms few months before narcolepsy onset, two patients few months after onset, and one patient one year after onset but after modafinil introduction.

Our simulation study showed that in the absence of an association between the vaccine and the outcome, presence of detection bias and differential exposure misclassification could account for elevated risk estimates. These may play a major role, particularly in alert situations when observation times are limited and the disease has a long latency period. Estimates from the case-control design were less inflated than those from the cohort design when these biases were present.

A retrospective study.,Kretzschmar U; Werth E; Sturzenegger C; Khatami R; Bassetti CL; Baumann CR,2016 Jun,Journal of sleep research,"Due to extensive clinical and electrophysiological overlaps, the correct diagnosis of disorders with excessive daytime sleepiness is often challenging. The aim of this study was to provide diagnostic measures that help discriminating such disorders, and to identify parameters, which don't. In this single-center study, we retrospectively identified consecutive treatment-naïve patients who suffered from excessive daytime sleepiness, and analyzed clinical and electrophysiological measures in those patients in whom a doubtless final diagnosis could be made. Of 588 patients, 287 reported subjective excessive daytime sleepiness. Obstructive sleep apnea is the only disorder that could be identified by polysomnography alone. The diagnosis of insufficient sleep syndrome relies on actigraphy as patients underestimate their sleep need and the disorder shares several clinical and electrophysiological properties with both narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic hypersomnia. Sleep stage sequencing on MSLT appears helpful to discriminate between insufficient sleep syndrome and narcolepsy. Sleep inertia is a strong indicator for idiopathic hypersomnia. There are no distinctive electrophysiological findings for the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome. Altogether, EDS disorders are common in neurological sleep laboratories, but usually cannot be diagnosed based on PSG and MSLT findings alone. The diagnostic value of actigraphy recordings can hardly be overestimated.",2016.0

Suspected narcolepsy cases aged older than 17 y were selected. The risk of narcolepsy following Pandemrix was calculated using cases diagnosed by the time of the center visits and those with a diagnosis by November 30, 2011 after which there was increased awareness of the risk in children. The odds of vaccination in cases and in matched population data were compared using a case-coverage design.

Of 1,446 possible cases identified, most had onset before 2009 or were clearly not narcolepsy. Of the 60 remaining cases, 20 were excluded after expert review, leaving 40 cases with narcolepsy; 5 had received Pandemrix between 3 and 18 mo before onset. All the vaccinated cases had cataplexy, two received a diagnosis by November 2011 and two were aged 40 y or older. The odds ratio for vaccination in cases compared to the population was 4.24 (95% confidence interval 1.45-12.38) using all cases and 9.06 (1.90-43.17) using cases with a diagnosis by November 2011, giving an attributable risk of 0.59 cases per 100,000 doses.

We found a significantly increased risk of narcolepsy in adults following Pandemrix vaccination in England. The risk was lower than that seen in children using a similar study design.",2016.0
26791511,Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures: An Updated Primer.,Baslet G; Seshadri A; Bermeo-Ovalle A; Willment K; Myers L,2016 Jan-Feb,Psychosomatics,"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures are the most common paroxysmal event misdiagnosed as epilepsy. They significantly affect quality of life, functional status, and use of medical resources.

The goal of this review is to provide guidance to psychiatrists and other mental health professionals in the understanding and practical management of this condition.

An abundance of new reports on the pathogenesis and effective treatments have become available over the last decade, yet specific barriers impede the fluid transition to treatment and remain an important challenge in the management of patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. In the context of these difficulties, we initially present background information on psychogenic non-epileptic seizures covering their historic context, epidemiology, etiologic factors (including psychiatric, neuromedical, and neuropsychological factors), and current neurobiological models. Updated evidence-based treatments are discussed along with data on long-term outcomes. We also provide practical tools to help clinicians navigate differential diagnoses, establish their interdisciplinary roles, communicate the diagnosis, deliver treatment, and sort out commonly encountered challenges in the management of this condition.",2016.0

Totally 66 patients with narcolepsy who were conformed international classification of sleep disturbances (ICSD-2) diagnostic criteria treated with atomoxetine hydrochloride seen from November 2010 to December 2014 were enrolled into this study, 42 of them were male and 24 female, mean age of onset was 7.5 years (3.75-13.00 years), mean duration before diagnosis was 1.75 years (0.25-5.00 years). Complete blood count, liver and kidney function, multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), polysomnography (PGS), neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed for each patient. For some of the children HLA-DR2 gene and serum markers of infection were tested. The 66 cases were followed up from 2 to 49 months (average 18 months) to observe the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions.

In 62 cases excessive daytime sleepiness was improved, in 11 cases (16.7%) it was controlled (16.7%), in 29 cases (43.9%) the treatment was obviously effective and in 22 (33.3%) it was effective; cataplexy occurred in 54 cases, in 18 (33.3%) it was controlled, in 19 (35.2%) the treatment was obviously effective and in 10 (18.5%) effective; night sleep disorders existed in 55 cases, in 47 cases it was improved, in 14 (25.5%) it was controlled, in 20 (36.4%) the treatment was obviously effective and in 13 (23.6%) effective; hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucination was present in 13 cases, in only 4 these symptoms were controlled. Sleep paralysis existed in 4 cases, it was controlled in only 1 case. In 18 cases attention and learning efficiency improved.Anorexia occurred in 18 cases, mood disorder in 5 cases, depression in 2 cases, nocturia, muscle tremors, involuntary tongue movement each occurred in 1 case. P-R interval prolongation and atrial premature contraction were found in 1 case.

Atomoxetine hydrochloride showed good effects in patients with narcolepsy on excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and night sleep disorders, the effects on hallucinations and sleep paralysis were not significant. Adverse reactions were slight, anorexia and mood disorder were common. As a non-central nervous system stimulant, atomoxetine hydrochloride does not induce drug dependence and has no prescription limits; it has good tolerability, safety and effectiveness, it can be a good alternative in treatment of children with narcolepsy.",2015.0
26599679,Idiopathic hypersomnia.,Billiard M; Sonka K,2016 Oct,Sleep medicine reviews,"Idiopathic hypersomnia continues to evolve from the concept of ""sleep drunkenness"" introduced by Bedrich Roth in Prague in 1956 and the description of idiopathic hypersomnia with two forms, polysymptomatic and monosymptomatic, by the same Bedrich Roth in 1976. The diagnostic criteria of idiopathic hypersomnia have varied with the successive revisions of the International classifications of sleep disorders, including the recent 3rd edition. No epidemiological studies have been conducted so far. Disease onset occurs most often during adolescence or young adulthood. A familial background is often present but rigorous studies are still lacking. The key manifestation is hypersomnolence. It is often accompanied by sleep of long duration and debilitating sleep inertia. Polysomnography (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is mandatory, as well as a 24 h PSG or a 2-wk actigraphy in association with a sleep log to ensure a total 24-h sleep time longer than or equal to 66O minutes, when the mean sleep latency on the MSLT is longer than 8 min. Yet, MSLT is neither sensitive nor specific and the polysomnographic diagnostic criteria require continuous readjustment and biologic markers are still lacking. Idiopathic hypersomnia is most often a chronic condition though spontaneous remission may occur. The condition is disabling, sometimes even more so than narcolepsy type 1 or 2. Based on neurochemical, genetic and immunological analyses as well as on exploration of the homeostatic and circadian processes of sleep, various pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed. Differential diagnosis involves a number of diseases and it is not yet clear whether idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy type 2 are not the same condition. Until now, the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia has mirrored that of the sleepiness of narcolepsy type 1 or 2. The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of modafinil have just been published, as well as a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of clarithromycine, a negative allosteric modulator of the γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor.",2016.0

Our aim was to assess the frequencies of smoking, alcohol and drug use, abuse and dependence in narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, hypocretin-deficient), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2), idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) (non-hypocretin-deficient conditions), in comparison to controls. We hypothesized that NT1 patients would be less vulnerable to drug abuse and addiction compared to other hypersomniac patients and controls from general population.

We performed a cross-sectional study in French reference centres for rare hypersomnia diseases and included 450 adult patients (median age 35 years; 41.3% men) with NT1 (n = 243), NT2 (n = 116), IH (n = 91), and 710 adult controls. All participants were evaluated for alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and substance (alcohol and illicit drug) abuse and dependence diagnosis during the past year using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.

An increased proportion of both tobacco and heavy tobacco smokers was found in NT1 compared to controls and other hypersomniacs, despite adjustments for potential confounders. We reported an increased regular and frequent alcohol drinking habit in NT1 versus controls but not compared to other hypersomniacs in adjusted models. In contrast, heavy drinkers were significantly reduced in NT1 versus controls but not compared to other hypersomniacs. The proportion of patients with excessive drug use (codeine, cocaine, and cannabis), substance dependence, or abuse was low in all subgroups, without significant differences between either hypersomnia disorder categories or compared with controls.

We first described a low frequency of illicit drug use, dependence, or abuse in patients with central hypersomnia, whether Hcrt-deficient or not, and whether drug-free or medicated, in the same range as in controls. Conversely, heavy drinkers were rare in NT1 compared to controls but not to other hypersomniacs, without any change in alcohol dependence or abuse frequency. Although disruption of hypocretin signaling in rodents reduces drug-seeking behaviors, our results do not support that hypocretin deficiency constitutes a protective factor against the development of drug addiction in humans.",2016.0

This analysis was conducted on data from the 2011, 2012, and 2013 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS; 2011 NHWS n = 75,000, 2012 NHWS n = 71,157, and 2013 NHWS n = 75,000). Patients who reported a narcolepsy diagnosis (n = 437) were matched 1:2 with controls (n = 874) on age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, household income, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use, exercise, and physical comorbidity. Chi-square tests and one-way analyses of variance were used to assess whether the narcolepsy and control groups differed on psychiatric comorbidities, HRQoL, labor force participation, work productivity, and healthcare resource utilization.

Patients with narcolepsy, in comparison to matched controls, reported substantially (two to four times) greater psychiatric comorbidity, HRQoL impairment, prevalence of long-term disability, absenteeism, and presenteeism, and greater resource use in the past 6 mo as indicated by higher mean number of hospitalizations, emergency department visits, traditional healthcare professional visits, neurologist visits, and psychiatrist visits (each p < 0.05).

These population-based data suggest that a narcolepsy diagnosis is associated with substantial adverse impact on mental health, HRQoL, and key economic burdens that include work impairment, resource use, and both direct and indirect costs. Although this study is cross-sectional, the results highlight the magnitude of the potential opportunity to improve mental health, lower costs, and augment work-related productivity through effective assessment and treatment of narcolepsy.",2016.0

Here, we describe two families with unique presentations who were enrolled in an IRB-approved study, extensively phenotyped, and whole exome sequencing (WES) performed. Family 1 had a diagnosis of isolated cataplexy triggered by sudden physical exertion in multiple affected individuals with heterogeneous neurological findings. All enrolled affected members carried a KCNA1 c.941T>C (p.I314T) mutation. Family 2 had an 8-year-old patient with muscle spasms with rigidity for whom WES revealed a previously reported heterozygous missense mutation in KCNA1 c.677C>G (p.T226R), confirming the diagnosis of EA1 without ataxia. WES identified variants in KCNA1 that explain both phenotypes expanding the phenotypic spectrum of diseases associated with mutations of this gene. KCNA1 mutations should be considered in patients of all ages with episodic neurological phenotypes, even when ataxia is not present. This is an example of the power of genomic approaches to identify pathogenic mutations in unsuspected genes responsible for heterogeneous diseases.",2016.0

Only a paucity of data has addressed clinical courses of sleep disorders with EDS. Therefore, we sought to compare clinical outcomes of patients presenting EDS.

A retrospective observational study was performed in the setting of sleep laboratory and outpatient department in a university hospital. One hundred and eight patients who presented EDS underwent polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test. Each patient was diagnosed as one of the following four categories: (1) narcolepsy with cataplexy (N + C; n = 29); (2) narcolepsy without cataplexy (N - C; n = 22); (3) idiopathic hypersomnia (IH; n = 24); and (4) subjective hypersomnolence (SH; n = 33) with mean sleep latency >8 min. Remission of EDS and treatment response were determined based on clinical evaluation. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed.

Remission rates were significantly different (P < 0.001, overall log-rank test) among four groups except those between N - C and IH (P = 0.489). While N + C showed no remission, predicted remission rates of N - C and IH group were 44.6% at 5 years and 32.5% at 5.5 years after diagnosis. The predicted remission rate of SH group was 71.7% at 3 years after diagnosis.

The similarity of clinical courses between N - C and IH suggests that N - C may be more related to IH compared to N + C. Considering different clinical courses among EDS patients, thorough evaluation of EDS should be warranted before starting treatment.",2016.0

Hypokinetic-rigid syndrome manifested at 83 years of age and Parkinson´s disease (PD) was diagnosed. Detailed examination at the age of 86 confirmed the previous diagnosis of NC and the diagnosis of PD. Severe periodic limb movements in sleep, severe sleep apnea, REM sleep behavior disorder and restless legs syndrome, which are frequently comorbid in NC and PD, were revealed. The patient's somnolence worsened, apparently accentuated by pramipexole treatment, as changing therapy to levodopa led to a reduction of sleepiness.",2015.0

The electronic medical records (EMRs) were searched for narcolepsy and JME over 10years.

We identified three young adult women diagnosed with JME in their teenage years, with myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, and absence seizure semiologies, along with psychiatric comorbidity, well managed on lamotrigine and/or levetiracetam. Our patients were also found to have disturbed sleep preceding the diagnosis of JME by many years, including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), fragmented nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic vivid hallucinations, and REM behavior disorder along with daytime cataplexy. They were ultimately diagnosed with coexisting narcolepsy, confirmed by sleep studies and multiple sleep latency testing, along with positive genetic testing for HLA-DQB1*0602 in all three patients. Stimulants, selective serotonin receptor inhibitors, and/or sodium oxybate were used to successfully treat their narcolepsy.

This study aimed to identify shared and distinctive clinical characteristics between NT1 and schizophrenia, with the focus on psychotic symptoms.

A total of 28 NT1 and 21 schizophrenia patients were included. Hallucination characteristics and PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale), HRSD (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), DES (Dissociative Experiences Scale), and STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) scores were collected. Symptom overlap was investigated by χ(2), Fisher's or t tests and multiple logistic regression models.

Hallucinations and illusions frequently occurred in both diseases. Unimodal hallucinations were more common in schizophrenia (p = 6.30e-07) and multimodal hallucinations in NT1, but no clear difference was identified in their sensory modality. Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations were typical of NT1 (p = 5.22e-07), and 25% of NT1 patients exhibited some degree of insight deficit. Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, unimodal hallucinations and PANSS score were the most distinctive clinical characteristics. Clinical overlap was found in the dissociative and anxiety domains, while higher depressive scores were observed in schizophrenia.

The main aim of this study was to investigate the utility of SOREMP in differential diagnosis of central hypersomnias.

The authors retrospectively evaluated consecutive 101 patients with a normal polysomnography other than the presence of SOREMP and/or REM without atonia and a latency of ≤8 minutes in MSLT.

The authors classified patients as follows: 52 patients had at least 2 SOREMPs (narcolepsy group), 23 had no SOREMPs (idiopathic hypersomnia group), and 26 patients had only 1 SOREMP (intermediate group). In polysomnographic recordings, both mean sleep latency and REM latency were significantly shorter in the narcolepsy (P = 0.012, P < 0.001, respectively) and intermediate groups (P = 0.005 and P = 0.035, respectively) compared with the idiopathic hypersomnia group. In MSLT recordings, sleep latency was 2.7 ± 2.2 minutes in the narcolepsy group, 3.6 ± 1.4 minutes in the intermediate group, and 5.2 ± 2.7 minutes in the idiopathic hypersomnia group (P < 0.001). The mean REM latency and sleep stages SOREMPs arised from were similar between the narcolepsy and intermediate groups.

To date, SOREMPs in MSLT and polysomnography remain the sole electrodiagnostic feature that discriminates narcolepsy without cataplexy from idiopathic hypersomnia. Different parameters or combined criteria are being increasingly investigated to increase the sensitivity and specificity of MSLT. The findings showed an altered instability of REM sleep not only in patients with 2 or more SOREMPs in MSLT but also in patients with one SOREMP.",2015.0

We performed a cross-sectional evaluation with 1,008 individuals from the Sao Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study (EPISONO). Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) was assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Volunteers were also asked about the occurrence of cataplectic-like, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis symptoms. The participants underwent a full-night polysomnography and completed questionnaires about psychological, demographic, and quality of life parameters.

We observed a prevalence of 39.2% of EDS, 15.0% of cataplectic-like symptom, 9.2% of hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and 14.9% of sleep paralysis in Sao Paulo city inhabitants. A frequency of 6.9% was observed when EDS and cataplectic-like symptoms were grouped. The other associations were EDS + hallucinations (4.7%) and EDS + sleep paralysis (7.5%).

Cases of narcolepsy from 1992 to 2013 were identified from searches of the Stanford Center for Narcolepsy Research database. International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition diagnosis criteria for type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy were used for inclusion, but subjects were separated as with and without cataplexy for the purpose of data presentation. Information extracted included demographics, ethnicity and clinical data, HLA-DQB1*06:02, polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) data, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 level.

182 African-Americans, 839 Caucasians, 35 Asians, and 41 Latinos with narcolepsy.

Sex ratio, PSG, and MSLT findings did not differ across ethnicities. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was higher and age of onset of sleepiness earlier in African Americans compared with other ethnicities. HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity was higher in African Americans (91.0%) versus others (76.6% in Caucasians, 80.0% in Asians, and 65.0% in Latinos).

Four patients with comorbidity for narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic generalized epilepsy are reported: in three cases the onset of epilepsy preceded narcolepsy type 1 appearance, whereas in one case epileptic spells onset was subsequent. Patients presented with absences, myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizure type: in the patient with tonic-clonic seizures the dual pathology was easily recognized, in the other cases the first diagnosis caused the comorbid disease to be overlooked, independent of the time-course sequence. All four patients underwent neurological examination, video-electroencephalogram during which ictal and interictal epileptic discharges were recorded, and sleep polysomnographic studies. Repeated sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) were documented with the multiple sleep latency test (MLST) in all the four cases. All patients had unremarkable brain magnetic resonance imaging studies and cerebrospinal hypocretin-1 was assessed in two patients, revealing undetectable levels. The association of antiepileptic drugs and substances currently used to treat narcolepsy type 1, including sodium oxybate, was effective in improving seizures, sleep disturbance, and cataplexy.

Narcolepsy type 1 may occur in association with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, leading to remarkable diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

The brain MRI was normal. 24h video-EEG monitoring revealed no abnormal slow or epileptiform discharge on interictal EEG, and no EEG change during tongue thrusting, dropping head with laughter, or flopping down, which was consistent with cataplexy associated with narcolepsy. A mean sleep latency of 2.5 min and four episodes of sleep-onset REM periods in five naps were observed in PSG with MSLT. She was positive in HLA-DQB1*0602.

Japanese journal of clinical medicine,"In clinical practice, assessment usually involves self-report; however, objective measures are available. The multiple sleep latency test(MSLT) is performed during the main period of wakefulness and is designed to determine a patient's propensity to fall asleep. To be valid, the MSLT should be performed the day after nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). It is the standard test for the assessment of objective sleepiness and diagnosis of narcolepsy, that is a mean sleep latency equal to or under 8 minutes and equal to or greater than two sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs). As opposed to the MSLT, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) is designed to test the patient's ability to stay awake. The MWT is a 40-minutes protocol consisting of four trials separated by 2-hour intervals and is performed in much the same way as the MSLT. The MWT may be indicated in assessment of individuals in whom the inability to remain awake constitutes a safety issue, or in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia to assess response to treatment with medications. There is little evidence linking mean sleep latency on the MWT with risk of accidents in real world circumstances. The suggestive immobilization test(SIT) was designed during which sensor and motor symptoms of restless legs syndrome are quantified during a period of immobility taking place in the evening before PSG. The patient is instructed to avoid moving voluntary for the entire duration of the test, which is designed to last 1 hour. The subjective leg discomfort evaluation and periodic leg movement by surface electromyograms from right and left anterior tibialis support diagnosis for restless legs syndrome. Many factors, such as clinical setting, pretest condition or aging effects etc. can alter the findings of the test and considerable clinical judgment is needed to avoid an error in interpretation. Above those three sleep-wake related tests provide us useful information.",2015.0

To assess the role of environmental factors in the development of narcolepsy-cataplexy, using a case-control design with control subjects being matched for ethnicity and age.

All patients were recruited through two outpatient clinics at the community of Madrid, ant the diagnosis of narcolepsy fulfilled the criteria of the International Classification on Sleep Disorders-2005. A questionnaire, including 54 environmental psychological stressor life events and 42 infectious diseases items, was administered to 54 patients. We specifically assessed the stressful factors and infectious diseases that occurred in the year preceding the onset of the first symptom of narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness and/or cataplexy). The same questionnaire was administered to 84 control subjects recruited from non-related family members of the same community.

Fifty four patients (55.6% males) answered the questionnaire, The mean age at onset of the first symptom was 21.6 ± 9.3 years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 36.5 ± 12.4 years. The main finding in narcoleptic patients as compared to control subjects was major changes in the 'number of arguments with partner, family, or friends' (odds ratio: 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.8-14.5). This can be interpreted as having a protective function and it suggests that psychological mechanisms are present since the beginning of the disease. As for the infectious factors, chickenpox was the most frequently reported.

26039966,Prevalence and Clinical Correlates of a Short Onset REM Period (SOREMP) during Routine PSG.,Cairns A; Bogan R,2015 Oct 1,Sleep,"The objectives of this study were to quantify the (1) sensitivity and specificity of nocturnal PSG SOREMP (REM latency ≤ 15 min) for narcolepsy in those being evaluated for hypersomnolence and (2) prevalence and predictors of SOREMP during baseline PSG for patients being evaluated for various sleep disorders.

This was a retrospective analysis of a large repository of de-identified PSG and MSLT test results from 2007 to 2013.

Patient records were retrieved from a repository of studies completed at a variety of sleep laboratories across the USA. Included in the analyses were 79,651 general sleep clinic patients (without an MSLT; 48% male; 72% Caucasian) and an additional 3,059 patients (31.3% male; 72% Caucasian) being evaluated for hypersomnolence (with a consecutive MSLT).

NA.

For patients being evaluated for hypersomnolence, the prevalence of PSG SOREMP increased in a dose-response fashion with the number of REM onsets that occurred on a consecutive MSLT (0.5% for no MSLT SOREMPs to > 33.0% for those with 5 MSLT SOREMPs). Overall, having a PSG SOREMP was highly specific (99.5%; 95% CI: 99.1-99.7%) but not sensitive (6.7%; 95% CI: 4.7-9.2%) for narcolepsy. The prevalence of PSG SOREMP for patients in the general sleep clinic sample (i.e., not being evaluated by a consecutive MSLT) was 0.8% and was much higher in those that work night/swing shift. In adjusted models, African American race contributed to the most variance in PSG SOREMP.

A short onset rapid eye movement (REM) latency occurs rarely in general sleep clinic samples (< 1.0%), but is highly specific for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. Although rare, the prevalence of the phenomenon is much higher than the estimated prevalence of narcolepsy and may provide a critical opportunity for practitioners to identify narcolepsy in sleep clinic patients. These data also suggest that the utility of polysomnography (PSG) short onset REM peroid (SOREMP) for the diagnosis of narcolepsy may be altered by a history of shift/night work and/ or other factors that may allow for a rebound of REM sleep (e.g., undergoing a positive airway pressure titration), supporting published guidelines that other sleep disorders and insufficient and/or poorly timed sleep should be ruled out and/or adequately controlled for prior to conducting sleep testing. Further research is needed to understand racial differences in PSG SOREMP and narcolepsy. This study was limited in that data on cataplexy (with exception to that in final diagnosis) and habitual sleep duration were not available.",2015.0

To compare the baseline differences in the sleep stage transition to REM sleep among 35 patients with type 1 narcolepsy, 39 patients with type 2 narcolepsy, 26 unaffected relatives, and 159 non-narcoleptic sleep patient controls, followed by a reassessment at a mean duration of 37.4 months.

The highest prevalence of altered transition from stage non-N2/N3 to stage R in multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) was found in patients with type 1 narcolepsy (92.0% and 57.1%), followed by patients with type 2 narcolepsy (69.4% and 12.8%), unaffected relatives (46.2% and 0%), and controls (39.3% and 1.3%). Individual sleep variables had varied sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing narcolepsy. By incorporating a combination of sleep variables, the decision tree analysis improved the sensitivity to 94.3% and 82.1% and enhanced specificity to 82.4% and 83% for the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy, respectively. There was a significant association of DBQ1*0602 with the altered sleep stage transition (OR = 16.0, 95% CI: 1.7-149.8, p = 0.015). The persistence of the altered sleep stage transition in both MSLT and NPSG was high for both type 1 (90.5% and 64.7%) and type 2 narcolepsy (92.3% and 100%), respectively.

Altered sleep stage transition is a significant and stable marker of narcolepsy, which suggests a vulnerable wake-sleep dysregulation trait in narcolepsy. Altered sleep stage transition has a significant diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of hypersomnias, especially when combined with other diagnostic sleep variables in decision tree analysis.",2015.0

Cross-sectional.

Sleep laboratory.

One hundred seventy-five patients with hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, n = 79), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2, n = 22), idiopathic hypersomnia (IH, n = 22), and ""subjective"" hypersomnolence (sHS, n = 52).

None.

Polysomnographic (PSG) work-up included 48 h of continuous PSG recording. From nocturnal PSG conventional sleep macrostructure, occurrence of sleep onset rapid eye movement period (SOREMP), sleep stages distribution, and sleep stage transitions were calculated. Patient groups were compared, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to test the diagnostic utility of nocturnal PSG data to identify NT1.

Sleep macrostructure was substantially stable in the 2 nights of each diagnostic group. NT1 and NT2 patients had lower latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and NT1 patients showed the highest number of awakenings, sleep stage transitions, and more time spent in N1 sleep, as well as most SOREMPs at daytime PSG and at multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) than all other groups. ROC curve analysis showed that nocturnal SOREMP (area under the curve of 0.724 ± 0.041, P < 0.0001), percent of total sleep time spent in N1 (0.896 ± 0.023, P < 0.0001), and the wakefulness-sleep transition index (0.796 ± 0.034, P < 0.0001) had a good sensitivity and specificity profile to identify NT1 sleep, especially when used in combination (0.903 ± 0.023, P < 0.0001), similarly to SOREMP number at continuous daytime PSG (0.899 ± 0.026, P < 0.0001) and at MSLT (0.956 ± 0.015, P < 0.0001).

Narcolepsy is a chronic disabling disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnogogic and/or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. All four features are present in only half of the cases. Excessive daytime sleepiness is the essential feature of narcolepsy at any age and is usually the first symptom to manifest. A combination of excessive daytime sleepiness and definite cataplexy is considered pathognomonic of narcolepsy syndrome.

New treatment options have become available over the past few years. Early diagnosis and management can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy.

Strength of association was graded between proposed process measures and desired outcomes. Following the AASM process for quality measure development, we identified three outcomes (including one outcome measure) and seven process measures. The first desired outcome was to reduce excessive daytime sleepiness by employing two process measures: quantifying sleepiness and initiating treatment. The second outcome was to improve the accuracy of diagnosis by employing the two process measures: completing both a comprehensive sleep history and an objective sleep assessment. The third outcome was to reduce adverse events through three steps: ensuring treatment follow-up, documenting medical comorbidities, and documenting safety measures counseling.

To present an overview of the literature on the incubus phenomenon and to provide practical advice regarding diagnosis and treatment.

To obtain information for our paper we carried out a search in PubMed and the historical literature.

The incubus phenomenon is a relatively unknown condition, even though, world-wide, it has a lifetime prevalence rate of 30% in the general population. The prevalence is even higher among students, psychiatric patients and patients with narcolepsy. It is attributed to a dissociation of the rem sleep phase and the subsequent intrusion of endogenously mediated percepts. The condition rarely requires treatment because it is self-limiting, and generally occurs only once in a lifetime. Repeated attacks, however, may warrant additional diagnostic testing with the aid of polysomnography and may require treatment with anxiolytics, antidepressants, anticholinergics or anti-epileptics.

The incubus phenomenon is an intrusive condition, but, as far as we currently know, it is benign. Nevertheless, it is important that the condition is recognised and not confused with a psychotic disorder or any other type of severe mental illness. When necessary, it should be treated lege artis.",2015.0

This incidence mainly increased in children and adolescents and, to a lesser degree, in adults.

125 unmedicated patients, aged 4 to 61 years, were included in this case-series study. Of these, 69 were diagnosed to have an H1N1-vaccine-related narcolepsy and 57 had sporadic narcolepsy. Most of these patients had: an actigraphy recording of 1-2 weeks, polysomnography, a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 concentration analysis.

Patients with H1N1-vaccine-related narcolepsy had shorter diagnostic delays, lower periodic leg movement index during sleep, earlier sleep-wake rhythm, and were younger in age at diagnosis, compared with sporadic cases. They also had shorter sleep latency and more sleep onset REM periods in MSLT, but these results were strongly age-dependent. Actigraphy showed quantitatively less sleep and more sleep fragmentation than polysomnography.

Regarding polysomnographic and actigraphic characteristics, there were no dramatic deviations between H1N1-vaccine-related and sporadic narcolepsy. Circadian rhythms indicated some interesting new findings with respect to the H1N1-vaccine-related disease. An actigraphy recording of 1-2 weeks is useful when studying the nocturnal aspects of narcolepsy and sleep-wake rhythms of narcoleptic patients.",2015.0
25458251,Clinical and practical considerations in the pharmacologic management of narcolepsy.,Thorpy MJ; Dauvilliers Y,2015 Jan,Sleep medicine,"Despite published treatment recommendations and the availability of approved and off-label pharmacologic therapies for narcolepsy, the clinical management of this incurable, chronic neurologic disorder remains challenging. While treatment is generally symptomatically driven, decisions regarding which drug(s) to use need to take into account a variety of factors that may affect adherence, efficacy, and tolerability. Type 1 narcolepsy (predominantly excessive daytime sleepiness with cataplexy) or type 2 narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness without cataplexy) may drive treatment decisions, with consideration given either to a single drug that targets multiple symptoms or to multiple drugs that each treat a specific symptom. Other drug-related characteristics that affect drug choice are dosing regimens, tolerability, and potential drug-drug interactions. Additionally, the patient should be an active participant in treatment decisions, and the main symptomatic complaints, treatment goals, psychosocial setting, and use of lifestyle substances (ie, alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, and cannabis) need to be discussed with respect to treatment decisions. Although there is a lack of narcolepsy-specific instruments for monitoring therapeutic effects, clinically relevant subjective and objective measures of daytime sleepiness (eg, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test) can be used to provide guidance on whether treatment goals are being met. These considerations are discussed with the objective of providing clinically relevant recommendations for making treatment decisions that can enhance the effective management of patients with narcolepsy.",2015.0

Comorbidity was detected by cognitive tests, polysomnography and detection of hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite normal sleep onset latency and only one episode of sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) in the multiple sleep latency test, where expressiveness is significantly reduced in cases of paralysis of horizontal eye movement, the diagnosis of parasomnia with narcolepsy cataplexy symptoms could be made.

The hypocretin level of 132 pg/ml measured in the cerebro spinal fluid is compatible with this diagnosis and shows the relevance of a detailed diagnostic of parasomnia in patients with Moebius syndrome.",2014.0

We analyzed the records of 148 patients and established diagnostic categories using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2(nd) Edition. Patient diagnoses included narcolepsy with cataplexy (28.4%), narcolepsy without cataplexy (8.1%), other hypersomnia conditions (9.5%), delayed sleep phase syndrome (12.2%), behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (4.1%), other sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements of sleep; 6.8%), isolated cataplexy (2%), and various diagnoses (29.1%). There were 54.8% of the N+C patients who had an nSOREMP, but only 2.4% of all other patients had an nSOREMP. The specificity of an nSOREMP for detection of N+C was high at 97.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.2-99.4%), but the sensitivity was moderate at 54.8% (95% CI: 38.7-70.2%). Overall, the positive predictive value of an nSOREMP for the diagnosis of N+C was 88.5% (95% CI: 69.8-97.4%).

In children, the presence of an nocturnal sleep onset rapid eye movement sleep period is highly suggestive of narcolepsy with cataplexy and provides further evidence of rapid eye movement sleep dysregulation in this condition.",2015.0

A population-based cohort study in the Vaccine Safety Datalink with an annual population of more than 8.5 million people. All persons younger than 30 years who received a 2009 pandemic or a 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine were identified. Their medical visit history was searched for a first-ever occurrence of an ICD-9 narcolepsy diagnosis code through the end of 2011. Chart review was done to confirm the diagnosis and determine the date of symptom onset. Cases were patients who met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd edition, narcolepsy diagnostic criteria. We compared the observed number of cases after vaccination to the number expected to occur by chance alone.

The number vaccinated with 2009 pandemic vaccine was 650,995 and with 2010-2011 seasonal vaccine was 870,530. Among these patients, 70 had a first-ever narcolepsy diagnosis code after vaccination, of which 16 had a chart-confirmed incident diagnosis of narcolepsy. None had their symptom onset during the 180 days after receipt of a 2009 pandemic vaccine compared with 6.52 expected, and 2 had onset after a 2010-2011 seasonal vaccine compared with 8.83 expected.

Influenza vaccines containing the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strain used in the United States were not associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy. Vaccination with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine viral antigens does not appear to be sufficient by itself to increase the incidence of narcolepsy in a population.",2014.0

Herniation of the left inferior temporal gyrus was revealed in MRI acquired with the suspicion of epilepsy. His overnight polysomnogram and multiple sleep latency tests were compatible with the diagnosis of narcolepsy. The other case, a two-year-old girl, was transferred from an outside hospital due to partial seizures with the fever. Herniation of the precuneal gyrus was encountered in MRI acquired after controlling her seizures with the initiation of phenytoin. The brain herniations of both patients were considered to be inconsistent with their medical conditions, so that they were symptom-free with only medical treatment for following three and six months, respectively.

These patients present diagnostic and treatment challenges and may shed new light on immune associations in schizophrenia.

Our case series was gathered at two narcolepsy specialty centers over a 9-year period. A questionnaire was created to improve diagnosis of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder in patients with narcolepsy. Pathophysiological investigations included full HLA Class I and II typing, testing for known systemic and intracellular/synaptic neuronal antibodies, recently described neuronal surface antibodies, and immunocytochemistry on brain sections to detect new antigens.

Ten cases were identified, one with schizoaffective disorder, one with delusional disorder, two with schizophreniform disorder, and 6 with schizophrenia. In all cases, narcolepsy manifested first in childhood or adolescence, followed by psychotic symptoms after a variable interval. These patients had auditory hallucinations, which was the most differentiating clinical feature in comparison to narcolepsy patients without psychosis. Narcolepsy therapy may have played a role in triggering psychotic symptoms but these did not reverse with changes in narcolepsy medications. Response to antipsychotic treatment was variable. Pathophysiological studies did not reveal any known autoantibodies or unusual brain immunostaining pattern. No strong HLA association outside of HLA DQB1*06:02 was found, although increased DRB3*03 and DPA1*02:01 was notable.

Narcolepsy can occur in association with schizophrenia, with significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Dual cases maybe under diagnosed, as onset is unusually early, often in childhood.

25064378,"Reclassification of clinical sleep disorders using traditional models of syndromic, neuroanatomic, pathophysiological and etiological diagnosis.",Spitzer AR,2014 Sep,Medical hypotheses,"Existing classifications of central nervous system sleep disorders do not often provide tools to diagnose the majority of patients complaining of sleep-related symptoms, nor always guide effective treatment. I present a novel classification system that completely separates clinical syndromes from anatomical localization, pathophysiology, and etiology. The clinical syndrome I present can describe the majority of patients, but can be fractionated into individual subgroups for further study. By then separating the anatomy and physiology from the symptoms, an avenue of research becomes available to study the different possible structures that regulate sleep, that may be damaged and cause syndromes of sleep dysfunction. Some of these may produce symptoms that overlap with narcolepsy and some may be distinct. Because the clinical syndrome should be distinguished from anatomy or physiology, I have proposed the term narcoleptiform syndrome for the clinical syndrome. The model also clearly separates etiology from anatomy in a classical neurological manner. This allows etiology, localization and symptoms to be studied separately. It is likely that different etiologies may produce damage in areas that produce similar syndromes. For example, in this model, different causes of damage to the orexin nucleus would result in the same clinical syndrome. This reinforces the concept of studying anatomy, symptoms and etiology separately. By studying the relationship of syndromes or symptoms to anatomic localization and pathophysiology, it should be possible to test novel approaches to treatment based on different underlying structure or function. For example, patients with lesions in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus or the thalamic intralaminar nuclei may both present with insomnia symptoms but need different treatment; or they might present with symptoms overlapping narcolepsy (a narcoleptiform syndrome) yet need different treatment. In some cases, a single treatment may cross over more than one location, and the best predictor might be symptoms. These are issues that need to undergo careful study on a syndromic, anatomic and physiological bases. This novel model opens up new avenues for understanding central nervous system sleep disorders, providing testable hypotheses regarding diagnosis and treatment.",2014.0

The inclusion criteria were patient age 4 to 18 years, onset of narcolepsy after January 2008, and diagnosis by the time of the key data-gathering visit in 2011. Clinical data came from hospital notes and general practitioner questionnaires. An expert panel validated the diagnoses.

Seventy-five patients with narcolepsy were identified (43 males, 32 females; mean age at onset 10y 4mo, range 3-18y). Of these patients, 11 received the Pandemrix vaccine before narcolepsy onset. On first presentation, there were more frequent reports of cataplexy, among other features, in vaccinated than in unvaccinated patients (82% vs 55%), but only excessive weight gain (55% vs 20%) was significantly more frequent (p=0.03). Facial hypotonia (p=0.03) and tongue protrusion (p=0.01) were eventually seen more frequently in vaccinated children.

Increased daytime sleepiness may be the only sign at the disease onset, with attacks of sleep becoming longer and lasting up to hours. Also present may be confusional arousals with features of sleep drunkenness. Paradoxically, preschool and young children may show inattentiveness, emotional lability, and hyperactive behavior. Cataplexy may develop after onset of sleepiness and affect mainly muscles of the face. Hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis are seldom present. Multiple Sleep Latency Test criteria are not available for children younger than 6 years. The haplotype (HLA-DQB1:0602) can be associated with the disorder; however, the best predictor of narcolepsy-cataplexy is hypocretin deficiency.

This review is meant to familiarize pediatricians with some of the more commonly encountered sleep disorders in this age group, and to review their diagnosis and management.

Recent findings reinforce the ubiquity of insufficient and poor-quality sleep in teens and their consequences on physical and mental health, cognition, and behavior. Increasing use of technology by teens, especially at night, plays a growing role in this. Parentally set bedtimes can be effective in increasing the sleep duration, thereby diminishing the consequences of insufficient sleep. Parasomnias, common in early childhood, usually diminish with the transition into adolescence. An almost 10-fold increase in the incidence of narcolepsy has been reported following the use of one type of vaccination against influenza H1N1 in Europe. Recent guidelines for the diagnosis and management of obstructive sleep apnea are reviewed, as are recent guidelines pertaining to the management of sleep disorders of children on the autism spectrum.

24931392,Narcolepsy: let the patient's voice awaken us!,Flygare J; Parthasarathy S,2015 Jan,The American journal of medicine,"This is a “patient-centered” review about narcolepsy that aims to awaken the reader to the narcolepsy condition and to the trials and tribulations of patients with sleep problems in general. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder with a classic tetrad of symptoms consisting of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep onset hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The diagnosis of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders are often overlooked and could be attributed to other medical or even psychiatric conditions with years of missed diagnosis. Implementation of “two sleep-related questions” to the review of systems in the primary care physicians’ office visit may help address the issue of missed diagnosis and allow patients to seek prompt medical attention. Definitive diagnosis can be made by overnight sleep study followed by a nap test, “multiple sleep latency test” (MSLT). There is currently no cure for narcolepsy with the treatments addressing symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and nighttime sleep disruption with stimulants (modafinil, methylphenidate, and amphetamines), anti-cataplexy medications (Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and sedative-hypnotics including sodium oxybate. Narcolepsy, like other sleep disorders, can lead to marked reductions of health-related quality of life and affect patients’ social and work lives deleteriously. While traditional healthcare approaches are focused more on hard biomedical outcomes, a patient-centered approach with novel methods for better sleep assessment of patients, that can bypass the “impossibly crammed” physician office visit, would allow healthcare providers to better detect, diagnose and treat narcolepsy and other such sleep problems.",2015.0

We compared the clinical characteristics of control subjects and patients with primary narcolepsy from data collected at the National Reference Centers for Narcolepsy.

The cohort included 69 control subjects (29 boys) and 117 patients (65 boys; 59 de novo patients). Cataplexy was present in 81% and DQB1*0602 was positive in 91%. The control children were older (13.5±3.2 vs. 11.6±3.1 years, P<0.001) and less obese (1.4% vs. 60%, P<0.001). Twenty-five percent of the patients and 15.6% of the control subjects had clinically significant depressive feelings on Children's Depression Inventory (CDI≥16) (NS). Fifty-three narcoleptic and 43 control adolescents, 31 narcoleptic children and 23 control children filled out the HRQL questionnaires as well as 83 parents of patients and 60 parents of control subjects. Narcolepsy seriously impacts HRQL in terms of vitality, physical well-being, relations with friends and leisure activities, especially in adolescents. Depression was the factor that most affected HRQL in both narcoleptic and control subjects. For the control subjects and the narcoleptic patients, when the CDI score was entered into the multivariable regression model adjusted for gender and age, no other continuous independent variable could significantly increase the likelihood of the model. When the CDI score increased by 1, the mean HRQL score decreased by 1.7 for narcoleptic patients and 1.5 for control subjects. Apnea-hypopnoea index, diagnosis delay, disease duration, obesity, the presence of cataplexy or treatment had no effects on HRQL.

Narcoleptic children and adolescents were at high risk for poor HRQL. Depressive symptoms had a major impact on HRQL. We recommend a more thorough assessment and management of psychological health in this population.",2014.0

Obtaining an accurate diagnosis often requires multiple tests and physician visits. This report describes results from an online, quantitative, company-sponsored survey in which physicians provided information from the charts of their patients with narcolepsy. Neurologists, pulmonologists, psychiatrists, and other specialists who were board certified in sleep medicine; had 2 to 30 years of clinical experience; and treated ≥ 5 narcolepsy patients per month were invited to complete ≤ 6 surveys using charts of patients who were treated for narcolepsy in the last 6 months. Data from 252 patients were collected from 77 physicians. Patients were predominantly male (55%), white (67%), and had a median age of 38 years (range: 12-83 years). Referral to the respondent physician was common, mainly from primary care physicians. The most common initial symptoms were excessive daytime sleepiness (91%), trouble staying awake during the day (44%), and trouble concentrating/functioning during the day (43%). Overall, initial symptoms were of at least moderate severity in 85% of patients. Most patients completed overnight polysomnography (83%), a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (76%), and/or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (62%). The median time from patient-reported symptom onset to diagnosis was 22 months (range: 0-126 months); at least half saw ≥ 2 providers before being diagnosed; and 60% of patients had previously been misdiagnosed with other disorders, including depression (31%), insomnia (18%), and/or obstructive sleep apnea (13%). In this study, the journey to a narcolepsy diagnosis required evaluation by multiple physicians and took nearly 2 years in 50% of patients, and > 5 years in 18%. These data highlight the need for increased awareness of the signs and symptoms of narcolepsy.",2014.0

In this report, we review the clinical and physiological aspects of narcolepsy without cataplexy, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures, and the differential diagnoses, and we propose an approach for more accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy.

A group of clinician-scientists experienced in narcolepsy reviewed the literature and convened to discuss current diagnostic tools, and to map out directions for research that should lead to a better understanding and more accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy.

To aid in the identification of narcolepsy without cataplexy, we review key indicators of narcolepsy and present a diagnostic algorithm. A detailed clinical history is mainly helpful to rule out other possible causes of chronic sleepiness. The multiple sleep latency test remains the most important measure, and prior sleep deprivation, shift work, or circadian disorders should be excluded by actigraphy or sleep logs. A short REM sleep latency (≤ 15 minutes) on polysomnography can aid in the diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy, although sensitivity is low. Finally, measurement of hypocretin levels can helpful, as levels are low to intermediate in 10% to 30% of narcolepsy without cataplexy patients.",2014.0
24830461,,,,,"Despite the classic tetrad of clinical features that typify it, narcolepsy remains much under-diagnosed, in part, because of the wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes, but also because of its insidious onset, usually in a young person. The median time to diagnosis from first symptoms remains very long, around 10 years in the UK. Conversely, in the specialist setting, it is likely over-diagnosed, largely because of failure to exclude other causes of hypersomnia. There is an over-reliance on a biological marker of the condition, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), which, like many tests, has a significant false-positive and false-negative rate. This review aims to discuss some of the difficulties in achieving a diagnosis, interpretation of investigations, differential diagnosis, and appropriate management of patients with narcolepsy.",
24780133,,,,,"Narcolepsy, a chronic neurologic condition resulting from dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle, usually has an onset at an early age. However, a long delay until diagnosis has been consistently reported in the literature across countries and several publications have focused on characterizing this delay. Most studies report a mean delay to diagnosis of up to 15 years, with individual cases of >60 years, although a trend over time toward a shorter diagnostic delay has been suggested. While variables associated with this delay have been identified, a lack of symptom recognition resulting in misdiagnosis prior to reaching the narcolepsy diagnosis is the likely underlying reason. This lack of symptom recognition is especially relevant considering the high comorbidity burden that has been shown in patients with narcolepsy as some disorders manifest with symptoms that overlap with narcolepsy. A consequence of delayed diagnosis is delayed treatment, which affects the burden of disease. Substantial detrimental effects on health-care resource utilization, employment, and quality of life have been described after narcolepsy onset and prior to the diagnosis of narcolepsy. This review highlights the importance of closing the diagnostic gap by expanding awareness of narcolepsy and its symptoms.",

A total of 9312 narcolepsy patients (>18 years of age, continuously insured between 2006 and 2010) and 46,559 matched controls were identified.

Compared with controls, narcolepsy subjects had approximately twofold higher annual rates of inpatient admissions (0.15 vs. 0.08), emergency department (ED) visits w/o admission (0.34 vs. 0.17), hospital outpatient (OP) visits (2.8 vs. 1.4), other OP services (7.0 vs. 3.2), and physician visits (11.1 vs. 5.6; all p<0.0001). The rate of total annual drug transactions was doubled in narcolepsy versus controls (26.4 vs. 13.3; p<0.0001), including a 337% and 72% higher usage rate of narcolepsy drugs and non-narcolepsy drugs, respectively (both p<0.0001). Mean yearly costs were significantly higher in narcolepsy compared with controls for medical services ($8346 vs. $4147; p<0.0001) and drugs ($3356 vs. $1114; p<0.0001).

24735736,,,,,"The diagnosis of narcolepsy is supported by the presence of two or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in the multiple latency sleep test (MSLT). The distribution of SOREMPs throughout the MSLT has not been systematically studied in narcolepsy. We studied the temporal distribution of SOREMPs in the MSLT of a large series of narcoleptics and calculated the effects of age and the diagnostic value of shorter versions of the test.

129 patients consecutively diagnosed with narcolepsy (73.4% with cataplexy) underwent nocturnal polysomnography followed by a five-nap MSLT.

429 SOREMPs were recorded in 645 MSLT naps (66.5%). The probability of presenting SOREMPs in the fourth nap (3:30 pm) was significantly lower than in the remaining naps: 22.4% SOREMPs in the first nap, 20.5% in the second, 20.5% in the third, 16% in the fourth and 20.5% in the fifth nap (p<0.034). Patients older than 29 years had less SOREMPs than the younger ones (p:0.045). Shortening the MSLT to three or four naps decreased the capability of the test to support the diagnosis of narcolepsy in 14.7 and 10% respectively.

The temporal distribution of SOREMPs in the MSLT is not even in narcolepsy, with the fourth nap having the lowest probability of presenting a SOREMP. This should be taken into account when evaluating the results of the MSLT, and particularly when using shorter versions of the test.",

(3) To investigate the determinants of the PSQI and ESS scores.

The PSQI and ESS as well as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which measures anxiety and depression levels, were administered to 367 patients consecutively referred to a sleep clinic. They underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test if narcolepsy was suspected.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the ESS and PSQI (and its subscale) were <0.9, meaning that these questionnaires were not highly accurate for predicting the four sleep disorders. The meta-analysis found that the ESS had no value in identifying OSA. The variable that most strongly influenced PSQI or ESS scores was the HADS score.

The PSQI and ESS should no longer be used as a screening or diagnostic instrument for the four PSG-defined sleep disorders, especially in a low-risk population.",
24656461,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a chronic disease and is commonly diagnosed in adulthood. However, more than half of the patients have onset of symptoms in childhood and/or adolescence. The full spectrum of clinical manifestations, namely excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis, is usually not present at disease onset, delaying diagnosis during childhood. Mean delay in diagnosis since symptom onset is known to be several years. Initial manifestations can sometimes be as subtle as only partial drooping of eyelids leading to confusion with a myasthenic condition.

We present two children who presented with ""cataplectic facies,"" an unusual facial feature only recently described in children with narcolepsy with cataplexy.

The diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by multiple sleep latency test along with human leukocyte antigen typing and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin assay.

The diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy at onset can be challenging in young children. With more awareness of subtle signs such as cataplectic facies, earlier diagnosis is possible. To date, only 11 children between 6 and 18 years of age presenting with typical cataplectic facies have been reported in the literature. We present two patients, one of whom is the youngest individual (4 years old) yet described with the typical cataplectic facies.",

The association between allergic and autoimmune diseases is also of considerable interest. There are no reports on the association between sporadic or familial narcolepsy with cataplexy and other non-neurological immune-mediated diseases. This study reported on the comorbid immunopathological diseases associated with narcolepsy. One-hundred and fifty six narcoleptic patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 39.1 ± 17.8 years (range, 6-70 years) were assessed using the clinical history, physical and neurological examinations, sleep questionnaires, neuroimaging and human leucocyte antigen typing. Diagnosis was confirmed by polysomnography followed by a multiple sleep latency test or by measuring hypocretin-1 levels. Patients with immunopathological diseases were matched for gender and age at the onset of narcoleptic symptoms with narcoleptic patients without immunopathological diseases. Twenty-six patients (16.6%; 50% women; one familial, 25 sporadic) had one or more immunopathological diseases associated: autoimmune diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune thyroid disease, Peyronie's disease and idiopathic recurrent facial palsy; other immunopathological diseases, like atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. Although not significant, the age at diagnosis of narcolepsy was 9.3 years earlier in patients with narcolepsy + immunopathological diseases.

Annual all-cause mortality rates for 2008, 2009, and 2010 were calculated retrospectively for patients with narcolepsy and patients without narcolepsy in the database, and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Mortality rates were also compared with the general US population (Centers for Disease Control data). SMRs of the narcolepsy population were consistent over the 3-year period and showed an approximate 1.5-fold excess mortality relative to those without narcolepsy. The narcolepsy population had consistently higher mortality rates relative to those without narcolepsy across all age groups, stratified by age decile, from 25-34 years to 75+ years of age. The SMR for females with narcolepsy was lower than for males with narcolepsy.

Our study sample included 88 children (44 boys; 44 de novo patients) with a mean age of 11.9 ± 3.1 years at diagnosis (37.5% were aged ⩽ 10 years). Obesity was found in 59% of the sample and cataplexy was present in 80.7%. The DQB1*0602 allele was positive in 93.5% of our sample. There were 25% of children who had clinically depressive feelings (CDI>16), especially girls older than the age of 10 years. Bivariate associations indicated that depressive feelings were associated with fatigue (48%), hyperactivity (31%), insomnia (16%), and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) (14-24%). In the multivariate model adjusted for gender and age, only fatigue explained the variability of the depression score.

In our large cohort, high levels of depressive symptoms essentially expressed by fatigue affected 25% of children with narcolepsy. The girls older than 10 years of age were especially vulnerable. The similar prevalence of depressive feelings in treated vs never-treated patients suggests a specific need for diagnosing and managing this symptom in young patients with narcolepsy.",

""Dream delusions"" were surprisingly common in narcolepsy and were often striking in their severity. As opposed to fleeting hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations of the sleep/wake transition, dream delusions were false memories induced by the experience of a vivid dream, which led to false beliefs that could persist for days or weeks.

The delusional confusion of dreamed events with reality is a prominent feature of narcolepsy, and suggests the possibility of source memory deficits in this disorder that have not yet been fully characterized.",

Working memory capacity was assessed by the listening span task. A version of this task (reading span) was presented to the participants during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Activation in the thalamus was measured in a region of interest analysis. A combination of the working memory capacity and the thalamic activation measures resulted in 80% prediction accuracy, 81% sensitivity, and 78% specificity regarding the ability to separate KLS patients from healthy controls. The controls had an inverse relation between working memory capacity and thalamic activation; higher performing participants had lower thalamic activation (r = -0.41). KLS patients showed the opposite relationship; higher performing participants had a tendency to higher thalamic activation (r = -0.35).

This study shows that functional neuroimaging of the thalamus combined with neuropsychological assessment of working memory function provides a means to guide diagnosis of Kleine-Levin Syndrome.

Thirty-three healthy children matched by age, race, sex, and household income served as controls.

Children with EDS were riskier pedestrians than healthy children. They were twice as likely to be struck by a virtual vehicle in the virtual pedestrian environment than healthy controls. Attentional skills of looking at oncoming traffic were not impaired among children with EDS, but decision-making for when to cross the street safely was significantly impaired.

Results suggest excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) from the clinical sleep disorders known as the hypersomnias of central origin may have significant consequences on children's daytime functioning in a critical domain of personal safety, pedestrian skills. Cognitive processes involved in safe pedestrian crossings may be impaired in children with EDS. In the pedestrian simulation, children with EDS appeared to show a pattern consistent with inattentional blindness, in that they ""looked but did not process"" information in their pedestrian environment.

24408296,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder. The classical presentation includes the four symptoms excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. As a model disease with all the transitions from awake to sleeping conditions, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM), it plays an important role in neurology and sleep medicine. Patients with narcolepsy possess a reduced number of hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus and accordingly the hypocretin level in the cerebrospinal fluid is low. The neuropeptide hypocretin (orexin) has functions, such as the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, the autonomous nerve system, motor system and metabolic processes. The delay in diagnosing narcolepsy is difficult to comprehend in modern medicine. The frequent association with other sleep-wake disorders may be responsible for the delay. Genomewide association studies have subsequently been able to prove that autoimmune mechanisms are responsible for the manifestation of narcolepsy with the HLA association being the most important for susceptibility and protection. Imaging studies have revealed neurodegenerative changes, making a multifactorial etiopathogenesis probable. The frequent occurrence of metabolic disorders has not yet been clarified. Early diagnosis of narcolepsy has the possibility to offer affected persons an adequate medication to lead an almost normal life and the future possibility to cure narcolepsy through immunomodulation therapy.",

The onset of disease of case one was started with epilepsy with myoclonic seizure. After half a year, catalepsy induced by emotion especially laughing and excessive daytime sleepiness appeared. MSLT was positive and hypocretin 1 level decreased. Narcolepsy-cataplexy was definitely diagnosed in this case. Valproate was given and seizure was controlled completely, but the excessive daytime sleepiness was aggravated. Combination of valproate, methylphenidate and clomipramine treatment improved the symptoms of narcolepsy and the patient was still free of epileptic seizures. The onset symptoms of case 2 were catalepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. MSLT was positive. The treatment was ineffective because of bad compliance. After 2 years, episodes of impairment of consciousness with automatism occurred. VEEG showed slow waves and spikes in right temporal area. Complex partial seizure was determined. Oxcarbazepine was used and then the patients became seizures free, but the symptoms of narcolepsy were still obvious.

Comorbidity of narcolepsy and epilepsy is a rare phenomenon. Clinical symptoms, predisposing factor, VEEG and MSLT can help diagnosis and differential diagnosis.

The level of hcrt-1 in narcolepsy patients was significantly lower than that of normal controls and the NC group was even lower than NWC group (20 (13, 36) vs 319 (244, 379) and 36 (15, 114) ng/L) (all P < 0.01).Using the international criteria of CSF hcrt-1 ≤ 110.0 ng/L or a level of 1/3 of mean normal control values, a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 90.6% were generated.ROC curve indicated that CSF hcrt-1 level of 138.0 ng/L was the best cutoff value for the diagnosis of narcolepsy in Chinese narcoleptic patients. There were a specificity of 100%, a sensitivity of 92.8% and the area under the ROC curve of 0.98.

CSF hcrt-1 measurement with high specificity and sensitivity is a useful diagnostic tool for Chinese narcoleptics. And the level of 138.0 ng/L may be the optimal cutoff for the diagnosis of narcolepsy in this group of patients.",
24144530,,,,,"Insufficient sleep is common in the general population, and can result from environmental and psychosocial factors, medical and psychiatric disorders, and sleep disorders, such as insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, sleep apnoea and restless legs. Women are particularly at risk for sleep disorders, and complaints of sleep disturbance are more prevalent among women than men across the life span. During the perinatal period, many common sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea or restless legs may be exacerbated, or in the case of insomnia or narcolepsy, treatment options may change. In addition, the role of circadian rhythms in fertility and perinatal health is just beginning to be appreciated. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the unique aspects of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders during the perinatal period.",
24142146,,,,,"Our aim was to investigate the natural evolution of cataplexy and polysomnographic features in untreated children with narcolepsy with cataplexy. To this end, clinical, polysomnographic, and cataplexy-video assessments were performed at diagnosis (mean age of 10 ± 3 and disease duration of 1 ± 1 years) and after a median follow-up of 3 years from symptom onset (mean age of 12 ± 4 years) in 21 children with narcolepsy with cataplexy and hypocretin 1 deficiency (tested in 19 subjects). Video assessment was also performed in two control groups matched for age and sex at first evaluation and follow-up and was blindly scored for presence of hypotonic (negative) and active movements. Patients' data at diagnosis and at follow-up were contrasted, compared with controls, and related with age and disease duration. At diagnosis children with narcolepsy with cataplexy showed an increase of sleep time during the 24 h; at follow-up sleep time and nocturnal sleep latency shortened, in the absence of other polysomnographic or clinical (including body mass index) changes. Hypotonic phenomena and selected facial movements decreased over time and, tested against disease duration and age, appeared as age-dependent. At onset, childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy is characterized by an abrupt increase of total sleep over the 24 h, generalized hypotonia and motor overactivity. With time, the picture of cataplexy evolves into classic presentation (i.e., brief muscle weakness episodes triggered by emotions), whereas total sleep time across the 24 h decreases, returning to more age-appropriate levels.",
24134219,,,,,"To investigate the association between vaccination with Pandemrix and risk of selected neurological and immune-related diseases including narcolepsy.

Population-based prospective cohort study using data from regional vaccination registries and national health registries.

Seven healthcare regions in Sweden comprising 61% of the Swedish population.

Study population of 3,347,467 vaccinated and 2,497,572 nonvaccinated individuals (vaccination coverage ≈ 60%) followed between 2009 and 2011 for 6.9 million person-years after exposure and 6.0 million person-years without exposure.

First recorded diagnosis of neurological and immune-related diseases. Relative risks [hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] assessed using Cox regression, adjusted for covariates.

For all selected neurological and immune-related outcomes under study, other than allergic vaccine reactions (for which we verified an expected increase in risk) and narcolepsy, HRs were close to 1.0 and always below 1.3. We observed a three-fold increased risk of a diagnosis of narcolepsy (HR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.78-4.79; that is, four additional cases per 100,000 person-years) in individuals ≤ 20 years of age at vaccination and a two-fold increase (HR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.00-4.75) amongst young adults between 21 and 30 years of age. The excess risk declined successively with increasing age at vaccination; no increase in risk was seen after 40 years of age.

For a large number of selected neurological and immune-related diseases, we could neither confirm any causal association with Pandemrix nor refute entirely a small excess risk. We confirmed an increased risk for a diagnosis of narcolepsy in individuals ≤ 20 years of age and observed a trend towards an increased risk also amongst young adults between 21 and 30 years.",
24127148,,,,,"To compare the amounts of REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) between patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), ""isolated loss of REM atonia,"" narcolepsy, and control subjects and determine if there were threshold values for the amount of RSWA that differentiate each group from controls.

Retrospective analyses of polysomnography (PSG) records were used employing strict quantitative criteria for the measurement of phasic and tonic EMG activity during REM sleep. The PSG recordings of 47 individuals were analyzed (RBD 16, isolated loss of REM atonia 11, narcolepsy 10, control 10).

Patients with the diagnosis of isolated loss of REM atonia had significantly lower levels of EMG activity during REM sleep than those with RBD but higher than control subjects. RSWA was higher in narcolepsy than in loss of REM atonia but lower than for RBD patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves provided threshold values with high specificity and sensitivity in all patient groups with a cutoff value ≥ 1.22% (100% correctly classified) for phasic and ≥ 3.17% for tonic (92% correctly classified) EMG activity in RBD.

Quantification of REM sleep EMG activity can successfully differentiate RBD and isolated loss of REM atonia patients from controls. The consistently increased amount of RSWA in patients with narcolepsy indicates that this can be an additional marker for a diagnosis of narcolepsy. Longitudinal studies of patients with isolated loss of REM atonia are needed to evaluate if these patients are at risk of developing RBD or neurodegenerative disorders.",

23946711,,,,,"Narcolepsy is reported to affect 26-56/100,000 in the general population. We aimed to describe clinical and polysomnographic features of a large narcolepsy cohort in order to comprehensively characterize the narcoleptic spectrum.

We performed a chart- and polysomnographybased review of all narcolepsy patients of the Innsbruck narcolepsy cohort.

A total of 100 consecutive narcolepsy patients (87 with cataplexy [NC], 13 without cataplexy [N]) were included in the analysis. All subjects had either excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy as their initial presenting clinical feature. Age at symptom onset was 20 (6-69) years. Diagnostic delay was 6.5 (0-39) years. The complete narcolepsy tetrad was present in 36/100 patients; 28/100 patients had three cardinal symptoms; 29/100 had two; and 7/100 had only excessive daytime sleepiness. Severity varied broadly with respect to excessive daytime sleepiness (median Epworth Sleepiness Scale score: 18, range 10-24), cataplexy (8-point Likert scale: median 4.5, range 1-8), hypnagogic hallucinations (median 4.5, range 1-7), and sleep paralysis (median 3, range 1-7). Sleep comorbidity was highly prevalent and ranged from sleeprelated movement disorders (n = 55/100), parasomnias (n = 34/100), and sleeprelated breathing disorders (n = 24/100), to insomnia (n = 28/100). REM sleep without atonia or a periodic limb movement in sleep index > 5/h were present in most patients (90/100 and 75/100). A high percentage of narcoleptic patients in the present study had high frequency leg movements (35%) and excessive fragmentary myoclonus (22%). Of the narcolepsy patients with clinical features of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), 76.5% had EMG evidence for RBD on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), based on a standard cutoff of a minimum of 18% of 3-sec miniepochs.

This study is one of the largest monocentric polysomnographic studies to date of patients with narcolepsy and confirms the frequent comorbidity of narcolepsy with many other sleep disorders. Our study is the first to evaluate the percentage of patients with high frequency leg movements and excessive fragmentary myoclonus in narcolepsy and is the first to demonstrate EMG evidence of RBD in the MSLT. These findings add to the growing body of literature suggesting that motor instability is a key feature of narcolepsy.",
23946709,,,,,"Differentiation of narcolepsy without cataplexy from idiopathic hypersomnia relies entirely upon the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). However, the test-retest reliability for these central nervous system hypersomnias has never been determined.

Patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and physiologic hypersomnia who underwent two diagnostic multiple sleep latency tests were identified retrospectively. Correlations between the mean sleep latencies on the two studies were evaluated, and we probed for demographic and clinical features associated with reproducibility versus change in diagnosis.

Thirty-six patients (58% women, mean age 34 years) were included. Inter -test interval was 4.2 ± 3.8 years (range 2.5 months to 16.9 years). Mean sleep latencies on the first and second tests were 5.5 (± 3.7 SD) and 7.3 (± 3.9) minutes, respectively, with no significant correlation (r = 0.17, p = 0.31). A change in diagnosis occurred in 53% of patients, and was accounted for by a difference in the mean sleep latency (N = 15, 42%) or the number of sleep onset REM periods (N = 11, 31%). The only feature predictive of a diagnosis change was a history of hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations.

The multiple sleep latency test demonstrates poor test-retest reliability in a clinical population of patients with central nervous system hypersomnia evaluated in a tertiary referral center. Alternative diagnostic tools are needed.",
23940246,,,,,"Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare and complex pediatric syndrome, essentially caused by dysfunction of 3 vital systems regulating endocrine, respiratory, and autonomic nervous system functioning. The clinical spectrum of ROHHAD is broad, but sleep/wake disorders have received relatively little attention so far, although the central hypothalamic dysfunction would make the occurrence of sleep symptoms likely. In this case report, we expand the phenotype of ROHHAD with a number of striking sleep symptoms that together can be classified as a secondary form of narcolepsy. We present a 7-year-old girl with ROHHAD who displayed the classic features of narcolepsy with cataplexy: excessive daytime sleepiness with daytime naps, visual hallucinations, and partial cataplexy reflected in intermittent loss of facial muscle tone. Nocturnal polysomnography revealed sleep fragmentation and a sleep-onset REM period characteristic for narcolepsy. The diagnosis was confirmed by showing an absence of hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid. We discuss potential pathophysiological implications as well as symptomatic treatment options.",
23904686,,,,,"Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN) is caused by DNMT1 mutations. Diagnosing the syndrome can be difficult, as all clinical features may not be present at onset, HLA-DQB1*06:02 is often negative, and sporadic cases occur. We report on clinical and genetic findings in a 31-year-old woman with cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy, and discuss diagnostic challenges.

Clinical and genetic investigation in a patient and family members.

Ataxia clinic, São Paulo, Brazil.

One patient and her family members.

N/A.

Narcolepsy was supported by polysomnographic and multiple sleep latency testing. HLA-DQB1*06:02 was positive. CSF hypocretin-1 was 191 pg/mL (normal values > 200 pg/mL). Mild brain atrophy was observed on MRI, with cerebellar involvement. The patient, her asymptomatic mother, and 3 siblings gave blood samples for genetic analysis. DNMT1 exons 20 and 21 were sequenced. Haplotyping of polymorphic markers surrounding the mutation was performed. The proband had a novel DNMT1 mutation in exon 21, p.Cys596Arg, c.1786T > C. All 4 parental haplotypes could be characterized in asymptomatic siblings without the mutation, indicating that the mutation is de novo in the patient.

The Brazilian patient reported here further adds to the worldwide distribution of ADCA-DN. The mutation is novel, and illustrates a sporadic case with de novo mutation. We believe that many more cases with this syndrome are likely to be diagnosed in the near future, mandating knowledge of this condition and consideration of the diagnosis.",
23884811,,,,,"An increased incidence of narcolepsy in children was detected in Scandinavian countries where pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine was used. A campaign of vaccination against pandemic H1N1 influenza was implemented in France using both ASO3-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines. As part of a study considering all-type narcolepsy, we investigated the association between H1N1 vaccination and narcolepsy with cataplexy in children and adults compared with matched controls; and compared the phenotype of narcolepsy with cataplexy according to exposure to the H1N1 vaccination. Patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy were included from 14 expert centres in France. Date of diagnosis constituted the index date. Validation of cases was performed by independent experts using the Brighton collaboration criteria. Up to four controls were individually matched to cases according to age, gender and geographic location. A structured telephone interview was performed to collect information on medical history, past infections and vaccinations. Eighty-five cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy were included; 23 being further excluded regarding eligibility criteria. Of the 62 eligible cases, 59 (64% males, 57.6% children) could be matched with 135 control subjects. H1N1 vaccination was associated with narcolepsy-cataplexy with an odds ratio of 6.5 (2.1-19.9) in subjects aged<18 years, and 4.7 (1.6-13.9) in those aged 18 and over. Sensitivity analyses considering date of referral for diagnosis or the date of onset of symptoms as the index date gave similar results, as did analyses focusing only on exposure to ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine. Slight differences were found when comparing cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy exposed to H1N1 vaccination (n=32; mostly AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, n=28) to non-exposed cases (n=30), including shorter delay of diagnosis and a higher number of sleep onset rapid eye movement periods for exposed cases. No difference was found regarding history of infections. In this sub-analysis, H1N1 vaccination was strongly associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy-cataplexy in both children and adults in France. Even if, as in every observational study, the possibility that some biases participated in the association cannot be completely ruled out, the associations appeared robust to sensitivity analyses, and a specific analysis focusing on ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine found similar increase.",
23835278,,,,,"This study has been carried out to test the clinical hypothesis of personal smell as a hint to the diagnosis of narcoleptic patients.

Sweat samples from narcoleptic and healthy controls were tested independently by two trained dogs and their positive or negative detection compared to the gold standard diagnosis for narcolepsy. Neither trainer nor dog knew the source of the sample selected or its placement in the search device. Twelve narcoleptic patients, both sexes and various ages, recruited from April 2011 to June 2012 and diagnosed according to standard criteria, through their clinical records and nocturnal polysomnography plus multiple sleep latency test, made up the patient group. The control group was made up of 22 healthy volunteer without sleep disorders, both sexes and various ages. Sweat samples from both patients and controls were collected following the same protocol to avoid contamination, and tested independently by two trained dogs.

Eleven narcoleptic were detected positive by the dogs while only three controls.

It seems that narcoleptic patients have a distinct typical odor that trained dogs can detect. The development of olfactory test could be a useful method in the screening of narcolepsy while opens a new research area.",
23817360,,,,,"Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is a group of distinct rare disorders (i.e. NPD-A; NPD-B; NPD-C) - with autosomal recessive inheritance pattern - within the class of the inborn disorders of the sphingolipid metabolism (called sphingolipidoses). Since patients with NPD-A do not survive into adulthood and most patients with NPD-B are free from neuropsychiatric symptoms we discuss only briefly type-A and -B NPD and mainly constrict our review discussing the neuropsychiatric symptoms along with the pathomechanism and the treatment of NPD-C. NPD-C is clinically heterogeneous, with notable variations in age at onset, course and symptoms. Along with systemic signs, neurologic and psychiatric symptoms are quite frequent in NPD-C and in its adult form sometimes psychiatric symptoms are the first ones appearing. Unfortunately, the majority of clinicans (including adult psychiatrists and neurologists) are not aware of the symptom group characteristic to NPD-C so patients with this disorder are frequently misdiagnosed in the clinical practice. Since neuropsychiatric manifestations of NPD-C may be treated with a substrate reduction agent (miglustat) with greater awareness of the identification of neuropsychiatric symptoms in due course is the prerequisite of proper and early diagnosis and treatment.",

MSLT showed borderline sleep latency, with 1 and 0 sleep onset REM periods. HLA typing disclosed the DQB1*0602 allele. Video-polygraphy of the spells ruled out NC diagnosis by demonstrating their easy elicitation by suggestion, with wake EEG, electromyographic persistence of muscle tone, and stable presence of tendon reflexes (i.e., pseudo-cataplexy), together with normal cerebrospinal hypocretin-1 levels. Our cases emphasize the need of a clear depiction of cataplexy pattern at the different ages, the usefulness of examining ictal neurophysiology, and collecting all available disease markers in ambiguous cases.",
23764105,,,,,"Discrimination between narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and behavior-induced inadequate sleep syndrome (BIISS) is based on clinical features and on specific nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results. However, previous studies have cast doubt on the specificity and sensitivity of these diagnostic tools.

Eleven variables of the NPSG were analyzed in 101 patients who were retrospectively diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C) (n=24), narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C) (n=38), idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep period (IHL) (n=21), and BIISS (n=18).

Fifteen out of 24 N+C and 8 out of 38 N-C entered the first rapid eye movement (REM) sleep period (FREMP) from sleep stage 1 (N1) or wake (W), though this sleep-stage sequence did not arise in the other patient groups. FREMP stage sequence was a function of REM sleep latency (REML) for both N+C and N-C groups. FREMP stage sequence was not associated with mean sleep latency (MSL) in N+C but was associated in N-C, which implies heterogeneity within the N-C group. REML also was a useful discriminator. Depending on the cutoff period, REML had a sensitivity and specificity of up to 85.5% and 97.4%, respectively.

The FREMP stage sequence may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of narcolepsy, particularly in conjunction with sleep-stage sequence analysis of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in the MSLT; it also may provide a helpful intermediate phenotype in the clarification of heterogeneity in the N-C diagnostic group. However, larger prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",
23746601,,,,,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an established indicator of astrogliosis. Therefore, variable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of this protein might reflect disease-specific pathologic profiles. In patients with narcolepsy, a loss of hypocretin-1 (hcrt-1) neurons in the brain and low concentrations of hcrt-1 in CSF have been reported. We performed a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to investigate if GFAP also is altered in the CSF of these patients. Here we detected significantly higher CSF levels of GFAP in patients with low hcrt-1 levels, of which the majority had a diagnosis of narcolepsy and cataplexy (NC); however, this finding was not observed in patients with hcrt-1 levels that were within reference range. In conclusion, GFAP may be useful as an additional disease biomarker in patients with narcolepsy, and this hypothesis should be investigated in larger studies.",

National Patient Registry.

All national diagnosed patients (757) with health information at least 3 years prior to and after diagnose of narcolepsy.

Randomly selected four citizens (3,013) matched for age, sex, and socioeconomic status from the Danish Civil Registration System Statistics.

Increased morbidity prior to narcolepsy diagnosis included (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval):- diseases of the endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic systems (2.10, 1.32-3.33); nervous system (5.27, 3.65-7.60); musculoskeletal system (1.59, 1.23-2.05); and other abnormal symptoms and laboratory findings (1.66, 1.25-2.22). After the diagnosis, narcolepsy patients experienced diseases of the endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic (2.31, 1.51-3.54), nervous (9.19, 6.80-12.41), musculoskeletal (1.70, 1.28-2.26), eye (1.67, 1.03-2.71), and respiratory systems (1.84, 1.21-2.81). Specific diagnoses were diabetes (2.4, 1,2-4.7, P < 0.01), obesity (13.4, 3.1-57.6, P < 0.001), sleep apnea (19.2, 7.7-48.3, P < 0.001), other sleep disorders (78.5, 11.8-523.3, P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.8, 1.4-5.8, P < 0.01), lower back pain (2.5, 1.4-4.2, P < 0.001), arthrosis/arthritis (2.5, 1.3-4.8, P < 0.01), observation of neurological diseases (3.5, 1.9-6.5, P < 0.001), observation of other diseases (1.7, 1.2-2.5, P < 0.01), and rehabilitation (5.0, 1.5-16.5, P < 0.005). There was a trend towards greater mortality in narcolepsy (P = 0.07).

23678276,,,,,"A 4-yr-old girl has exhibited severe snoring, restless sleep and increasing daytime sleepiness over the last 3 months. The physical examination showed that she was not obese but had kissing tonsils. Polysomnography demonstrated increased apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 5.2, and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) showed shortened mean sleep latency and one sleep-onset REM period (SOREMP). She was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. After the surgery, her sleep became much calmer, but she was still sleepy. Another sleep test showed normal AHI of 0.2, the mean sleep latency of 8 min, and two SOREMPs. Diagnosis of OSA to be effectively treated by surgery and narcolepsy without cataplexy was confirmed. Since young children exhibiting both OSA and narcolepsy can fail to be diagnosed with the latter, it's desirable to conduct MSLT when they have severe daytime sleepiness or fail to get better even with good treatment.",
23649748,,,,,"Narcolepsy, a disorder associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02 and caused by hypocretin (orexin) deficiency, is diagnosed using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) following nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG). In many patients, a short rapid eye movement sleep latency (REML) during the NPSG is also observed but not used diagnostically.

To determine diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of nocturnal REML measures in narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency.

Observational study using receiver operating characteristic curves for NPSG REML and MSLT findings (sleep studies performed between May 1976 and September 2011 at university medical centers in the United States, China, Korea, and Europe) to determine optimal diagnostic cutoffs for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency compared with different samples: controls, patients with other sleep disorders, patients with other hypersomnias, and patients with narcolepsy with normal hypocretin levels. Increasingly stringent comparisons were made. In a first comparison, 516 age- and sex-matched patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency were selected from 1749 patients and compared with 516 controls. In a second comparison, 749 successive patients undergoing sleep evaluation for any sleep disorders (low pretest probability for narcolepsy) were compared within groups by final diagnosis of narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. In the third comparison, 254 patients with a high pretest probability of having narcolepsy were compared within group by their final diagnosis. Finally, 118 patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency were compared with 118 age- and sex-matched patients with a diagnosis of narcolepsy but with normal hypocretin levels.

Sensitivity and specificity of NPSG REML and MSLT as diagnostic tests for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. This diagnosis was defined as narcolepsy associated with cataplexy plus HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity (no cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 results available) or narcolepsy with documented low (≤ 110 pg/mL) cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 level.

Short REML (≤15 minutes) during NPSG was highly specific (99.2% [95% CI, 98.5%-100.0%] of 516 and 99.6% [95% CI, 99.1%-100.0%] of 735) but not sensitive (50.6% [95% CI, 46.3%-54.9%] of 516 and 35.7% [95% CI, 10.6%-60.8%] of 14) for patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency vs population-based controls or all patients with sleep disorders undergoing a nocturnal sleep study (area under the curve, 0.799 [95% CI, 0.771-0.826] and 0.704 [95% CI, 0.524-0.907], respectively). In patients with central hypersomnia and thus a high pretest probability for narcolepsy, short REML remained highly specific (95.4% [95% CI, 90.4%-98.3%] of 132) and similarly sensitive (57.4% [95% CI, 48.1%-66.3%] of 122) for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (area under the curve, 0.765 [95% CI, 0.707-0.831]). Positive predictive value in this high pretest probability sample was 92.1% (95% CI, 83.6%-97.0%).

Among patients being evaluated for possible narcolepsy, short REML (≤15 minutes) at NPSG had high specificity and positive predictive value and may be considered diagnostic without the use of an MSLT; absence of short REML, however, requires a subsequent MSLT.",
23648914,,,,,"The study of genetics is providing new and exciting insights into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Both normal sleep and several types of sleep disturbances have been found to have significant genetic influences, as have traits of normal sleep, such as those evident in EEG patterns and the circadian sleep-wake cycle. The circadian sleep-wake cycle is based on a complex feedback loop of genetic transcription over a 24-h cycle. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) have familial aggregation, and several genes have a strong association with them. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to RLS/PLMS, although none has a definite functional correlation. Narcolepsy/cataplexy are associated with HLA DQB1*0602 and a T-cell receptor α locus, although functional correlations have not been evident. Obstructive sleep apnea is a complex disorder involving multiple traits, such as anatomy of the oropharynx, ventilatory control, and traits associated with obesity. Although there is clear evidence of familial aggregation in the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, no specific gene or locus has been identified for it. Angiotensin-converting enzyme has been proposed as a risk variant, but evidence is weak. Fatal familial insomnia and advanced sleep phase syndrome are sleep disorders with a definite genetic basis.",
23622295,,,,,"Paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders are very frequent in infants and children and pediatric neurologists need to be as familiar with them as with epileptic seizures. Syncopes are the most important of these episodic disorders and amongst the syncopes the various subtypes of so-called neurally mediated syncopes (vagal, vasovagal, and so forth) predominate. In such syncopes there is almost always a trigger or provoking situation and this is the major clinical clue to the diagnosis. Whatever the mechanism of a syncope it is commonly ""convulsive"" in that there is a motor element, with tonic extensions and arrhythmic nonepileptic spasms (""jerks""). This everyday situation must be distinguished from the much less common combination of a syncope and a true epileptic seizure. In such anoxic-epileptic seizures the epileptic component is usually clonic, with rhythmic or semi-rhythmic jerks quite different from the arrhythmic spasms of the usual nonepileptic convulsive syncope. Syncope from compulsive Valsalva maneuver may be extremely frequent in affected (usually autistic) children. Diagnosis is easy if one obtains a video recording with audio: the premonitory hyperventilation stops leaving 11 seconds of silence before the tonic extension that signifies the syncope. Syncopes of more serious kind include those in long QT syndrome, hyperekplexia, paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, and congenital myasthenia; each has recognizable characteristics. Other nonsyncopal nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders are described further in the text.",
23574649,,,,,"To evaluate the impact of obesity on clinical and sleep characteristics in a population of narcoleptic children.

Data from the children diagnosed with idiopathic narcolepsy in the National Reference Centers for Narcolepsy were collected between 2008 and 2011. Clinical and electrophysiological characteristics were compared between obese (body mass index [BMI] greater than P97) and nonobese children.

The 117 children (65 boys, 59 de novo patients) had a mean age of 11.6 ± 3.1 years on diagnosis. Cataplexy was present in 81%, DQB1*0602 in 91%. Mean BMI was 23.2 ± 5.2 kg/m(2) and BMI z-score was 2.9 ± 2.6. Obesity was found in 60% with a similar prevalence in treated versus de novo patients and in patients with and without cataplexy. Sleepiness and cataplexy started earlier in obese children. Obese narcoleptic children had lower sleep efficiency, higher apnea hypopnea index and respiratory arousals index (RAI) than nonobese children. BMI z-score was positively correlated with RAI. Obese children were more tired and missed more often school than nonobese children.

Obesity affects more than 50% of narcoleptic children, mostly younger at disease onset, and has a deleterious impact on sleep quality as well as on school attendance.",
23496005,,,,,"The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and PSG characteristics of narcolepsy with cataplexy and their genetic predisposition by using the retrospective patient database of the European Narcolepsy Network (EU-NN). We have analysed retrospective data of 1099 patients with narcolepsy diagnosed according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2. Demographic and clinical characteristics, polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test data, hypocretin-1 levels, and genome-wide genotypes were available. We found a significantly lower age at sleepiness onset (men versus women: 23.74 ± 12.43 versus 21.49 ± 11.83, P = 0.003) and longer diagnostic delay in women (men versus women: 13.82 ± 13.79 versus 15.62 ± 14.94, P = 0.044). The mean diagnostic delay was 14.63 ± 14.31 years, and longer delay was associated with higher body mass index. The best predictors of short diagnostic delay were young age at diagnosis, cataplexy as the first symptom and higher frequency of cataplexy attacks. The mean multiple sleep latency negatively correlated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and with the number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs), but none of the polysomnographic variables was associated with subjective or objective measures of sleepiness. Variant rs2859998 in UBXN2B gene showed a strong association (P = 1.28E-07) with the age at onset of excessive daytime sleepiness, and rs12425451 near the transcription factor TEAD4 (P = 1.97E-07) with the age at onset of cataplexy. Altogether, our results indicate that the diagnostic delay remains extremely long, age and gender substantially affect symptoms, and that a genetic predisposition affects the age at onset of symptoms.",
23444425,,,,,"To evaluate the risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents in England targeted for vaccination with ASO3 adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 vaccine (Pandemrix) from October 2009.

Retrospective analysis. Clinical information and results of sleep tests were extracted from hospital notes between August 2011 and February 2012 and reviewed by an expert panel to confirm the diagnosis. Vaccination and clinical histories were obtained from general practitioners.

Sleep centres and paediatric neurology centres in England.

Children and young people aged 4-18 with onset of narcolepsy from January 2008.

The odds of vaccination in those with narcolepsy compared with the age matched English population after adjustment for clinical conditions that were indications for vaccination. The incidence of narcolepsy within six months of vaccination compared with the incidence outside this period measured with the self controlled cases series method.

Case notes for 245 children and young people were reviewed; 75 had narcolepsy (56 with cataplexy) and onset after 1 January 2008. Eleven had been vaccinated before onset; seven within six months. In those with a diagnosis by July 2011 the odds ratio was 14.4 (95% confidence interval 4.3 to 48.5) for vaccination at any time before onset and 16.2 (3.1 to 84.5) for vaccination within six months before onset. The relative incidence from the self controlled cases series analysis in those with a diagnosis by July 2011 with onset from October 2008 to December 2010 was 9.9 (2.1 to 47.9). The attributable risk was estimated as between 1 in 57,500 and 1 in 52,000 doses.

The increased risk of narcolepsy after vaccination with ASO3 adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 vaccine indicates a causal association, consistent with findings from Finland. Because of variable delay in diagnosis, however, the risk might be overestimated by more rapid referral of vaccinated children.",
23385695,,,,,"This review discusses the various causes of primary hypersomnias with emphasis on clinical recognition, diagnosis, and treatment options.

Narcolepsy is probably the most fascinating syndrome causing excessive daytime sleepiness. With increasing understanding of the hypocretin/orexin pathways and the neurotransmitters that subserve the role of wakefulness and sleep, newer therapeutic modalities with promising results are being investigated and opening new frontiers in the treatment of this rare but devastating disease.

This article reviews the primary hypersomnias of central origin. Where possible, clinical cases that highlight and explain the clinical syndromes are included. Treatment modalities and future directions are also discussed to help the clinician identify and treat the underlying disorder.",
23372264,,,,,"We analyzed the potential predictive factors for precocious puberty, observed in some cases of childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) and for obesity, a much more common feature of NC, through a systematic assessment of pubertal staging, body mass index (BMI), and metabolic/endocrine biochemical analyses.

Cross-sectional on consecutive recruitment.

Hospital sleep center and pediatric unit.

Forty-three children and adolescents with NC versus 52 age-matched obese children as controls.

N/A.

Patients underwent clinical interview, polysomnographic recordings, cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 measurement, and human leukocyte antigen typing. Height, weight, arterial blood pressure, and Tanner pubertal stage were evaluated. Plasma lipid and glucose profiles were analyzed. When an altered pubertal development was clinically suspected, plasma concentrations of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis hormones were determined. Children with NC showed a high prevalence of overweight/obesity (74%) and a higher occurrence of precocious puberty (17%) than obese controls (1.9%). Isolated signs of accelerated pubertal development (thelarche, pubic hair, advanced bone age) were also present (41%). Precocious puberty was significantly predicted by a younger age at first NC symptom onset but not by overweight/obesity or other factors. In addition, overweight/obesity was predicted by younger age at diagnosis; additional predictors were found for overweight/obesity (short disease duration, younger age at weight gain and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), which did not include precocious puberty. NC symptoms, pubertal signs appearance, and body weight gain developed in close temporal sequence.

NC occurring during prepubertal age is frequently accompanied by precocious puberty and overweight/obesity, suggesting an extended hypothalamic dysfunction. The severity of these comorbidities and the potential related risks require a multidiagnostic approach and a tailored therapeutic management.",
23312376,,,,,"Guidelines for the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were published in 1986 and updated in 2005. Individual interpretation of instructions may lead to variability in conducting and reporting the test with implications for diagnosis.

To assess variability in conducting MSLT among sleep laboratories in Europe.

A questionnaire based on the clinical MSLT guidelines was posted or emailed to 283 sleep centres in Europe.

Ninety adult laboratories performing MSLT returned the questionnaire. Indications for MSLT were: narcolepsy, excessive daytime somnolence, driving issues and assessment of wakefulness. Routinely, only 17% of laboratories performed urinary drug screening and 68.2% asked patients to complete sleep diaries. Overnight polysomnography before MSLT was ran in 87.5% of laboratories. There was variation in setup and instructions among countries. Sleep onset was scored as one epoch of any stage sleep by 65.9% of labs. REM latency was calculated and reported according to the 2005 guidelines in 73.7% of cases. Abnormal daytime sleepiness was considered to be a sleep latency⩽5min in 33% laboratories.

There is marked variability in the practice and interpretation of the MSLT in Europe.",
23246544,,,,,"In August 2010 reports of a possible association between exposure to AS03 adjuvanted pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine and occurrence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents emerged in Sweden and Finland. In response to this signal, the background rates of narcolepsy in Europe were assessed to rapidly provide information for signal verification.

We used a dynamic retrospective cohort study to assess the narcolepsy diagnosis rates during the period 2000-2010 using large linked automated health care databases in six countries: Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Overall, 2608 narcolepsy cases were identified in almost 280 million person years (PY) of follow up. The pooled incidence rate was 0.93 (95% CI: 0. 90-0.97) per 100,000 PY. There were peaks between 15 and 30 year of age (women>men) and around 60 years of age. In the age group 5-19 years olds rates were increased after the start of pandemic vaccination compared to the period before the start of campaigns, with rate ratios (RR) of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-3.1) in Denmark, 6.4 (95% CI: 4.2-9.7) in Finland and 7.5 (95% CI: 5.2-10.7) in Sweden. Cases verification in the Netherlands had a significant effect on the pattern of incidence over time.

The results of this incidence study provided useful information for signal verification on a population level. The safety signal of increased narcolepsy diagnoses following the start of the pandemic vaccination campaign as observed in Sweden and Finland could be observed with this approach. An increase in narcolepsy diagnoses was not observed in other countries, where vaccination coverage was low in the affected age group, or did not follow influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination. Patient level analyses in these countries are being conducted to verify the signal in more detail.",
23175331,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a chronic hypersomnia characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and manifestations of disrupted rapid eye movement sleep stage (cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations). Mechanisms underlying narcolepsy are not fully understood. Experimental data indicate that the disease is caused by a loss of hypocretin neurons in the hypothalamus, likely due to an autoimmune process triggered by environmental factors in susceptible individuals. Most patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy have very low hypocretin-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. An appropriate clinical history, polysomnogram, and multiple sleep latency test are necessary for diagnosis of the disease. Additionally, two biological markers, i.e., cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and expression of the DQB1*0602 gene, are used. The treatment of narcolepsy is aimed at the different symptoms that the patient manifests. Excessive daytime sleepiness is treated with psychostimulants (amphetamine-like, modafinil and armodafinil). Cataplexy is treated with sodium oxybate (GHB), tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and fragmented sleep may be treated with sodium oxybate. Patients with narcolepsy should follow proper sleep hygiene and avoid strong emotions.",
23085931,,,,,"The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) remains an important diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of hypersomnias. However, a positive MSLT may be found in other sleep disorders, such as behaviourally induced inadequate sleep syndrome (BIISS). It has been demonstrated that in sleep onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) periods in BIISS, REM sleep tends to arise from stage 2 sleep (non-REM (NREM) 2), rather than stage 1 sleep (NREM1), as in narcolepsy.

We performed sleep stage sequence analysis on 127 patients with nocturnal polysomnography and MSLT, including 25 with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C), 41 with narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C), 21 with idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time (IHL), 20 with BIISS and 20 with periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). 537 naps were recorded, containing 176 SOREM periods.

All SOREM periods in the IHL, BIISS and PLMD groups arose from NREM2 sleep, 75% of those in N+C arose from NREM1 and in N-C only 52% arose from NREM1. Within the N-C group, those with SOREM periods all arising from stage 1 had a shorter MSL (p=0.02).

These results suggest that SOREM periods arising from NREM1 have high sensitivity for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and that SOREM periods from NREM1 are a marker of severity, either of sleepiness or REM instability. Sleep stage sequence analysis of SOREM periods may also aid more accurate phenotyping of the hypersomnias and in particular clarify heterogeneity among patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy.",
23065655,,,,,"Narcolepsy and other syndromes associated with excessive daytime sleepiness can be challenging to treat. New classifications now distinguish narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (also called type 1 narcolepsy), a lifelong disorder with well-established diagnostic procedures and etiology, from other syndromes with hypersomnolence of unknown causes. Klein-Levin Syndrome, a periodic hypersomnia associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, is also considered a separate entity with separate therapeutic protocols. Non hypocretin-related hypersomnia syndromes are diagnoses of exclusion. These diagnoses are only made after eliminating sleep deprivation, sleep apnea, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and psychiatric comorbidities as the primary cause of daytime sleepiness. The treatment of narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency is well-codified, and involves pharmacotherapies using sodium oxybate, stimulants, and/or antidepressants, plus behavioral modifications. These therapies are almost always needed, and the risk-to-benefit ratio is clear, notably in children. Detailed knowledge of the pharmacological profile of each compound is needed to optimize use. Treatment for other syndromes with hypersomnolence is more challenging and less codified. Preferably, therapy should be conservative (such as modafinil, atomoxetine, behavioral modifications), but it may have to be more aggressive (high-dose stimulants, sodium oxybate, etc.) on a case-by-case, empirical trial basis. As cause and evolution are unknown in these conditions, it is important to challenge diagnosis and therapy over time, keeping in mind the possibility of tolerance and the development of stimulant addiction. Kleine-Levin Syndrome is usually best left untreated, although lithium can be considered in severe cases with frequent episodes. Guidelines are provided based on the literature and personal experience of the author.",
23044019,,,,,"Narcolepsy is characterized by recurrent brief attacks of irresistible sleepiness. Signs can begin during childhood. However, diagnoses are frequently delayed by 10-15 years because of unfamiliarity with pediatric narcolepsy and variable presentations of its associated features (cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis). Therefore, patients may remain untreated during their formative years. Three children with narcolepsy who were initially misdiagnosed are described. Each child's signs were initially related to depression, hypothyroidism, jaw dysfunction, or conversion disorder. However, after a multiple sleep latency test, the diagnosis of narcolepsy was established. All three patients were treated appropriately with stimulant medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or sodium oxybate, and demonstrated positive responses. Although no definitive cure exists for narcolepsy, early recognition and appropriate symptomatic treatment with medications can allow affected children to improve quality of life and achieve normality, both academically and socially.",
23026503,,,,,"To investigate in narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) patients of working age (18-65 years) the influence of age at onset, age at diagnosis and clinical features on socio-occupational conditions, disease-related economic burden, and quality of life.

One hundred consecutive patients underwent a semistructured interview on socio-occupational aspects, NC-related direct and indirect costs, and NC history. Questionnaires were used to evaluate excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, depressive symptoms, and quality of life.

NC patients (51 males, mean age 37±11.5 years) had educational and occupational levels similar to those of the Italian population of the same age range, but married less often, especially if NC onset occurred at a young age. Total annual NC-related costs were €9814 ± 10,372 per patient. Multivariate analyses showed that patients with NC onset before the age of 30 years had a higher educational level, married less frequently, and were less frequently unemployed or inactive (retired, housewife). Patients diagnosed before the age of 30 years were less frequently unemployed or inactive, had fewer work changes, and had a better general health perception. Irresistible sleepiness was associated with work absences and higher indirect costs. Depressive symptoms were strongly associated with lower quality-of-life scores.

NC age at onset and at diagnosis modulates the disease-related burden. A diagnosis at a young age could improve patients' occupational prognosis, and their general health perception.",

Although the first symptoms often appear during childhood, paediatric narcolepsy is often underrecognised and underdiagnosed. The presentation can be very variable, this making diagnosis difficult. We describe a paediatric case with narcolepsy. The patient had the typical symptoms with excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks and cataplexy. The aim of this case report is to draw paediatricians' attention to childhood narcolepsy.

22942503,,,,,"To compare clinical, electrophysiologic, and biologic data in narcolepsy without cataplexy with low (≤ 110 pg/ml), intermediate (110-200 pg/ml), and normal (> 200 pg/ml) concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1.

University-based sleep clinics and laboratories.

Narcolepsy without cataplexy (n = 171) and control patients (n = 170), all with available CSF hypocretin-1.

Retrospective comparison and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Patients were also recontacted to evaluate if they developed cataplexy by survival curve analysis.

The optimal cutoff of CSF hypocretin-1 for narcolepsy without cataplexy diagnosis was 200 pg/ml rather than 110 pg/ml (sensitivity 33%, specificity 99%). Forty-one patients (24%), all HLA DQB1*06:02 positive, had low concentrations (≤ 110 pg/ml) of CSF hypocretin-1. Patients with low concentrations of hypocretin-1 only differed subjectively from other groups by a higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score and more frequent sleep paralysis. Compared with patients with normal hypocretin-1 concentration (n = 117, 68%), those with low hypocretin-1 concentration had higher HLA DQB1*06:02 frequencies, were more frequently non-Caucasians (notably African Americans), with lower age of onset, and longer duration of illness. They also had more frequently short rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep latency (≤ 15 min) during polysomnography (64% versus 23%), and shorter sleep latencies (2.7 ± 0.3 versus 4.4 ± 0.2 min) and more sleep-onset REM periods (3.6 ± 0.1 versus 2.9 ± 0.1 min) during the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Patients with intermediate concentrations of CSF hypocretin-1 (n = 13, 8%) had intermediate HLA DQB1*06:02 and polysomnography results, suggesting heterogeneity. Of the 127 patients we were able to recontact, survival analysis showed that almost half (48%) with low concentration of CSF hypocretin-1 had developed typical cataplexy at 26 yr after onset, whereas only 2% had done so when CSF hypocretin-1 concentration was normal. Almost all patients (87%) still complained of daytime sleepiness independent of hypocretin status.

Objective (HLA typing, MSLT, and sleep studies) more than subjective (sleepiness and sleep paralysis) features predicted low concentration of CSF hypocretin-1 in patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy.",
22889297,,,,,"The occurrence of sleep disorder in three half sibling Lipizzaner is described. Sleepiness, swaying, stumbling, carpal joints buckling and falling down onto the carpal joints had been present since early foal age in all of them. Clinical signs had gradually reduced since the age of 2 years in cases 1 and 3. Sleepiness was induced by going out from the stable in adulthood. A physostigmine test was performed in all three affected horses and produced positive results in cases 1 and 3. The result of the test in case 2 was unclear due to the almost continuous sleepiness of the foal. Hypocretin-1 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was established using a standardised radioimmunoassay in case 1 (317.85 pg/mL), case 2 (303.43 pg/mL) and five adult control horses (275.2 ± 47.9 [SD] pg/mL) and was considered as normal in all horses. The sire of the affected horses has had 19 other registered offspring who did not show clinical signs of sleep disorder and also dams of all three cases produced healthy foals. Based on the demographic and clinical data together with the responses to the physostigmine challenges, the diagnosis of familial equine narcolepsy was made.",
22841027,,,,,"Despite the fact that narcolepsy is a chronic disorder affecting younger people, there is insufficient information about its societal burden, time course, and familiar effect. We aimed to estimate the factual direct and indirect costs of narcolepsy patients and their families in a national sample using a controlled study design.

Using records from the Danish National Patient Registry (1997-2009), all 816 narcolepsy patients and their partners were identified and compared with 3254 randomly chosen controls matched for age, gender, geographic area, and civil status. Direct and indirect costs, including frequencies of primary and secondary sector contacts' and procedures, medication, labor supply, and social transfer payments were extracted from the national databases.

Fewer patients (46.7%) than controls (51.4%) were married or cohabiting. Patients with narcolepsy had significantly higher rates of health-related contact, medication use, and a higher socioeconomic cost. Furthermore, they had lower employment rates, and those in employment had a lower income level than control subjects. Partners presented higher public health insurance and public transfers and lower income from employment. In all, the annual mean excess health-related cost, including social transfers, was €9572 for patients with narcolepsy and €3606 for their partners (both p<0.001). Patient consequences could be identified up to 11 years before first diagnosis and became more pronounced as the disease advanced.

Narcolepsy causes socioeconomic consequences, not only for patients, but also for their partners, which is present years prior to disease diagnosis, confirming a diagnostic delay.",
22716477,,,,,"In the diagnostic work-up of hypersomnias of central origin, the complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness should be objectively confirmed by MSLT findings. Indeed, the features and diagnostic utility of spontaneous daytime sleep at 24 h continuous polysomnography (PSG) have never been investigated. We compared daytime PSG features to MSLT data in 98 consecutive patients presenting with excessive daytime sleepiness and with a final diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy/hypocretin deficiency (n = 39), narcolepsy without cataplexy (n = 7), idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time (n = 19), and 'hypersomnia' with normal sleep latency at MSLT (n = 33). Daytime sleep time was significantly higher in narcolepsy-cataplexy but similar in the other groups. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves showed that the number of naps during daytime PSG predicted a mean sleep latency ≤8 min at MSLT with an area under the curve of 0.67 ± 0.05 (P = 0.005). The number of daytime sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in spontaneous naps strikingly predicted the scheduled occurrence of two or more SOREMPs at MSLT, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.93 ± 0.03 (P < 10(-12) ). One spontaneous SOREMP during daytime had a sensitivity of 96% with specificity of 74%, whereas two SOREMPs had a sensitivity of 75%, with a specificity of 95% for a pathological REM sleep propensity at MSLT. The features of spontaneous daytime sleep well correlated with MSLT findings. Notably, the occurrence of multiple spontaneous SOREMPs during daytime clearly identified patients with narcolepsy, as well as during the MSLT.",
22605629,,,,,"Narcolepsy is an emblematic, unique disease within sleep disorders that is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and other abnormal manifestations of REM sleep. In the last 14 years truly spectacular progress has been made in our knowledge of this disease, since the discovery of its cause, i.e. a loss of the hypothalamic neurons that synthesise hypocretin, a previously unknown neurotransmitter, and its probable aetiopathogenic mechanisms, i.e. an autoimmune process in a patient with very precise immunological characteristics - a specific type of HLA and a specific type of T-cell receptor. The cause of this autoimmune process remains unknown. The definitive treatment - the administration of hypocretin, which is the substance missing in the organism - is still unavailable, but there are powerful drugs for treating its main symptoms, the sleepiness and the cataplexy. Some of these are classic compounds (methylphenidate, clomipramine), while others are more recent (modafinil, venlafaxine, sodium oxybate), but together they allow many patients to experience significant improvements. Lack of knowledge about the disease, both on the part of patients and their relatives as well as physicians, is the reason for the great delay in its diagnosis, with even more dramatic consequences when the disease begins in infancy.",
22596015,,,,,"We report a 5-year-old boy with epilepsy and narcolepsy-cataplexy. He developed myoclonic seizures at the age of 4 years, which manifested as head shaking to the left. Approximately 6 months later, narcolepsy-cataplexy with excessive daytime sleepiness occurred. Although a short-time electroencephalography (EEG) and 24-hour ambulatory EEG monitoring found epileptiform discharges, no seizures were determined. Oxcarbazepine was used and led to increased attacks. Video EEG testing finally confirmed the diagnosis of epilepsy; therefore, valproate was given and seizures were controlled completely. Typical cataplexy triggered by laughing, together with the positive multiple sleep latency tests confirmed a diagnosis of narcolepsy-cataplexy. Human leukocyte antigens DQB1*0602 was positive, and the hypocretin level in cerebrospinal fluid was found to be decreased. Combination of valproate, methylphenidate, and clomipramine treatment improved the symptoms of both narcolepsy-cataplexy and seizure. The coexistence of both disorders in this single patient indicated that there might be a common mechanism between epilepsy and narcolepsy-cataplexy.",
22558075,,,,,"Narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) is a disabling sleep disorder characterized by early loss of hypocretin neurons that project to areas involved in the attention network. We characterized the executive control of attention in drug-free patients with NC to determine whether the executive deficits observed in patients with NC are specific to the disease itself or whether they reflect performance changes due to the severity of excessive daytime sleepiness.

Twenty-two patients with NC compared to 22 patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy (NwC) matched for age, gender, intellectual level, objective daytime sleepiness and number of sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) were studied. Thirty-two matched healthy controls were included. All participants underwent a standardized interview, completed questionnaires, and neuropsychological tests. All patients underwent a polysomnography followed by multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT), with neuropsychological evaluation performed the same day between MSLT sessions.

Irrespective of diagnosis, patients reported higher self-reported attentional complaints associated with the intensity of depressive symptoms. Patients with NC performed slower and more variably on simple reaction time tasks than patients with NwC, who did not differ from controls. Patients with NC and NwC generally performed slower, reacted more variably, and made more errors than controls on executive functioning tests. Individual profile analyses showed a clear heterogeneity of the severity of executive deficit. This severity was related to objective sleepiness, higher number of SOREMPs on the MSLT, and lower intelligence quotient. The nature and severity of the executive deficits were unrelated to NC and NwC diagnosis.

We demonstrated that drug-free patients with NC and NwC complained of attention deficit, with altered executive control of attention being explained by the severity of objective sleepiness and global intellectual level. Further studies are needed to explore whether medications that promote wakefulness can improve the executive functions in narcolepsy.",
22547897,,,,,"Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, irresistible sleep episodes, and sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) mostly triggered by emotions. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a disabling lifelong disorder frequently arising during childhood. Pediatric narcolepsy often results in severe learning and social impairment. Improving awareness about this condition increases early diagnosis and may allow patients to rapidly access adequate treatments, including pharmacotherapy and/or non-medication-based approaches. Even though children currently undergo pharmacotherapy, data about safety and efficacy in the pediatric population are scarce. Lacking international guidelines as well as drugs registered for childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy, physicians have no other alternative but to prescribe in an off-label manner medications identical to those recommended for adults. We retrospectively evaluated 27 children ranging from 6 to 16 years old, suffering from narcolepsy with cataplexy, who had been treated with off-label sodium oxybate and had been followed in a clinical setting. Throughout a semi-structured interview, we documented the good efficacy and tolerability of sodium oxybate in the majority of the patients. This study constitutes a preliminary step towards a further randomized controlled trial in childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy.",
22470453,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder with strong genetic predisposition causing excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. A sudden increase in childhood narcolepsy was observed in Finland soon after pandemic influenza epidemic and vaccination with ASO3-adjuvanted Pandemrix. No increase was observed in other age groups.

Retrospective cohort study. From January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010 we retrospectively followed the cohort of all children living in Finland and born from January 1991 through December 2005. Vaccination data of the whole population was obtained from primary health care databases. All new cases with assigned ICD-10 code of narcolepsy were identified and the medical records reviewed by two experts to classify the diagnosis of narcolepsy according to the Brighton collaboration criteria. Onset of narcolepsy was defined as the first documented contact to health care because of excessive daytime sleepiness. The primary follow-up period was restricted to August 15, 2010, the day before media attention on post-vaccination narcolepsy started.

Vaccination coverage in the cohort was 75%. Of the 67 confirmed cases of narcolepsy, 46 vaccinated and 7 unvaccinated were included in the primary analysis. The incidence of narcolepsy was 9.0 in the vaccinated as compared to 0.7/100,000 person years in the unvaccinated individuals, the rate ratio being 12.7 (95% confidence interval 6.1-30.8). The vaccine-attributable risk of developing narcolepsy was 1:16,000 vaccinated 4 to 19-year-olds (95% confidence interval 1:13,000-1:21,000).

Pandemrix vaccine contributed to the onset of narcolepsy among those 4 to 19 years old during the pandemic influenza in 2009-2010 in Finland. Further studies are needed to determine whether this observation exists in other populations and to elucidate potential underlying immunological mechanism. The role of the adjuvant in particular warrants further research before drawing conclusions about the use of adjuvanted pandemic vaccines in the future.",
22445591,,,,,"To evaluate the efficacy and side effect profile of sodium oxybate in the treatment for narcolepsy-cataplexy in the pediatric age group.

A retrospective study was conducted on 15 children and adolescents with narcolepsy-cataplexy who had been treated with sodium oxybate. The mean age at diagnosis of narcolepsy was 11 years (range 3-17 years). Subjects were followed for 3-90 months (mean 33) after starting sodium oxybate. During this period of time they were also maintained on other medications for sleepiness (n=14) and cataplexy (n=6). The charts were reviewed for documentation of improvement in sleepiness or cataplexy, side effects, and functioning in daily life.

Subsequent to the addition of sodium oxybate, sleepiness improved in 13/15 patients. In patients who had Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) assessments, the score fell from a baseline median of 18 to 12 (n=10, p=0.01). The number of cataplexy episodes estimated by parents decreased from a median of 38/week pre-treatment to <1/week post treatment (n=14, p<0.001). Cataplexy severity, measured on an arbitrary scale, fell from a median of 3 (severe) to 1 (mild) in all 15 subjects (p<0.001). Two of the 15 patients (13%) discontinued sodium oxybate, one for insurance reasons and the other due to constipation and dissociative feelings. A third patient stopped the medication temporarily due to body aches and dizziness, but then resumed treatment without recurrence of symptoms. Side effects in four others included tremor, blurring of vision, nocturnal awakenings, and increased nightmares. Overall, side effects occurred in 6/15 (40%) individuals. Improvement in social/academic spheres was noted in 11/15 (73%) subjects after starting sodium oxybate. The median BMI before and after treatment remained unchanged at 23 (n=14, p=0.99). Median values of height and weight before and after treatment also did not change significantly. The mean dose of sodium oxybate was 5 ± 2 g. Dose escalation owing to development of tolerance was not encountered.

Sodium oxybate is effective in alleviating sleepiness and cataplexy in childhood onset narcolepsy-cataplexy. The therapeutic response was sustained over time, and without development of tolerance. Forty percent of the subjects experienced adverse effects.",
22406785,,,,,"Narcolepsy is not an uncommon sleep disorder in the West. There is, however, only one reported case in literature from India. In this study, we report characteristics of patients with narcolepsy over a seven-year period.

Details of all patients with narcolepsy seen at a Sleep Disorders Clinic over seven years were analyzed. Diagnosis had been established by clinical history and two or more Sleep Onset Rapid Eye Movement Periods (SOREMPs) on Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) following an overnight Polysomnography (PSG), using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders - 2 (ICSD-2) criteria. Patients fulfilling the criteria, but suffering from other disorders were excluded.

Data of 20 patients were analyzed and 4 patients were excluded, as they had other associated conditions. Mean age at onset of symptoms was 25±10 years; 12 (60%) patients had narcolepsy with cataplexy, 4 (20%) patients presented with all cardinal symptoms of narcolepsy, 8 (40%) with 3 symptoms, while 8 (40%) presented with 2 symptoms. History of Excessive Day-Time Sleepiness (EDS) was present in all patients. Three patients reported accidents due to sleep attacks, one being life-threatening. On PSG, mean sleep efficiency was 79.4±12.40%. Mean sleep latency during MSLT was 1.30 minute (range: 0.30-2.30 minute) and mean REM latency was 2.58±0.64 minute.

Narcolepsy with and without cataplexy is infrequently seen in the North Indian population; however, clinical and polysomnographic features are similar to those observed in Western and other Asian populations.",
22249574,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a neurologic disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and manifestations of disrupted rapid eye movement sleep stage. The pathologic hallmark is loss of hypocretin neurons in the hypothalamus likely triggered by environmental factors in a susceptible individual. Patients with narcolepsy, in addition to excessive daytime sleepiness, can present with cataplexy, sleep paralysis, sleep fragmentation, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations. Approximately 60% to 90% of patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy, characterized by sudden loss of muscle tone. Only 15% of patients manifest all of these symptoms together. Narcolepsy can be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder or even epilepsy. An appropriate clinical history, polysomnogram, Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and, at times, cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin levels are necessary for diagnosis. The treatment of narcolepsy is aimed toward the different symptoms that the patient manifests. Excessive daytime sleepiness is treated with amphetamine-like or non-amphetamine-like stimulants. Cataplexy is treated with sodium oxybate, tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and fragmented sleep may be treated with benzodiazepine hypnotics or sodium oxybate. Patients with narcolepsy should avoid sleep deprivation, sleep at regular hours, and, if possible, schedule routine napping.",

Of 1,152 consecutive PD patients, 3 had a prior diagnosis of narcolepsy. This rate is five times higher than expected (p = 0.02). These patients had typical onset of narcolepsy and underwent treatment with amphetamine. Although preliminary, this observation raises the possibility that some factors intrinsic to narcolepsy or its treatment may be a risk factor for PD.",
22136902,,,,,"We carried out a systematic video-polysomnographic analysis of the number and type of motor events during REM sleep in narcolepsy-cataplexy patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (NC + RBD) but not clinical RBD (NC-RBD).

Twelve NC + RBD and 10 NC-RBD male patients underwent video-polysomnography (video-PSG). Motor events of different type and complexity (i.e., elementary and complex movements and vocalizations) occurring during REM sleep were visually assessed, and indices of their frequency per hour of REM sleep were calculated. Subsequently, the index values were compared in NC + RBD versus NC-RBD patients.

Typical RBD behaviors observed in five NC + RBD patients were not included in any type of motor events. No objective conventional sleep parameter, including visual analysis of chin electromyographic (EMG) activity, significantly differed between the two groups of NC patients. NC + RBD patients showed higher occurrence of elementary movements (p = 0.034) during REM sleep compared with NC-RBD patients, but the occurrence of complex movements did not differ significantly.

Video-analysis of motor events during REM sleep may improve the diagnosis of RBD in NC. RBD in NC patients is mainly characterized by elementary rather than complex movements, consistent with the view that RBD with NC patients displays a distinct phenotype with respect to other RBD patients.",
22182320,,,,,"There is a high incidence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in narcoleptic patients. Some narcoleptics with SDB may benefit from treatment with continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP). The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of SDB in narcoleptics referred to a tertiary sleep disorders clinic and assess the effectiveness of CPAP as adjunctive therapy.

A retrospective review of patients meeting ICSD-2 criteria for the diagnosis of narcolepsy from 2000 to 2009.

One hundred and two patients (61 women) with narcolepsy were included in the study. Twenty-nine (29) patients (eight women, 21 men) were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) of whom 26 commenced CPAP therapy with 11 patients concurrently treated with stimulants. Patients with narcolepsy and OSAHS were older (P = 0.009) and heavier (BMI, 29.6 ± 4.8 vs. 27.3 ± 6, P = 0.042), but their ESS did not differ from patients with narcolepsy alone. Patients treated with both CPAP and stimulants were younger (P = 0.008) and less obese (BMI, 29.1 ± 4.6 vs. 30.4 ± 5.4, P = 0.044) with higher apnoea-hypopnoea index (36.15 ± 21.9 vs. 31.5 ± 16.7, P = 0.03) than those treated with CPAP alone. The ESS of CPAP-treated patients improved during follow-up (19 ± 3.6 vs. 15.8 ± 4.5, P = 0.006), but BMI increased (30.6 ± 5 vs. 31.7 ± 5.6, P = 0.05). The use of stimulants did not seem to improve on the effectiveness of CPAP.

Coexisting SDB is common in narcoleptics (28.5%). CPAP therapy in narcoleptics with OSAHS remains a useful second-line adjunct to standard therapy.",
22171197,,,,,"In adults with narcolepsy, periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) occur more frequently than in control population, and presence of increased PLMS is associated with greater sleep disruption and shorter mean sleep latency. This study was performed to determine whether PLMS are common in children with narcolepsy, and whether the presence of PLMS is associated with greater sleep disruption.

Demographic and polysomnographic information were collected from consecutive patients diagnosed with narcolepsy identified retrospectively by diagnosis-based search. Descriptive data were compiled, and sleep characteristics of children with and without PLMS were compared.

Sleep disorders center in a children's hospital.

44 patients, 6-19 years old (mean 13 years, SD 3.57), were identified. Twenty-eight were African American.

None.

Four patients had a PLMS index (PLMI) ≥ 5/h (considered abnormal in literature). Sixteen (36%) had ""any PLMS"" (PLMI > 0/h). The mean PLMI was 1.3/h (SD 2.5). Sleep was significantly more disrupted, and the mean sleep latency was shorter in patients with ""any PLMS"" as compared to those with no PLMS. There was no correlation between the PLMI and other diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy. ""Any PLMS"" were present equally in children of African American and Caucasian heritage, 35.7% vs. 37.5%.

As in adults, children with PLMS and narcolepsy have more sleep disruption and shorter mean sleep latencies than those with narcolepsy but without PLMS. Our findings also suggest that the use of adult criteria for diagnosis of ""significant"" PLMS in children may not be sufficiently sensitive.",
21946744,,,,,"There has been no attempt to survey New Zealanders with narcolepsy to determine their pathway to diagnosis, symptoms, treatment, or quality of life. We therefore aimed to develop a comprehensive questionnaire, and compare responses on measures of daytime sleepiness and quality of life between individuals with narcolepsy and the general New Zealand population.

A questionnaire was developed encompassing descriptive information, daytime sleepiness and sleep habits, general health and wellbeing, diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy, symptoms, and quality of life. Ninety-two individuals were identified through medical specialists and a local support group.

Complete responses were obtained from 54 individuals (63% female, mean age 54.7 ± 18.3 years). The mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 16.4 ± 5.4 (/24). Symptoms first appeared at 20.7 ± 9.7 years of age on average, although diagnosis did not take place until 33.4 ± 13.8 years of age. Individuals with narcolepsy reported substantially lower health-related quality of life than the general New Zealand population. Less than half of those diagnosed with narcolepsy had undergone an objective evaluation including a sleep study.

New Zealanders with narcolepsy suffer from an excessive level of daytime sleepiness, and have significantly poorer health-related quality of life than the general population. There are a number of inconsistencies between the diagnostic pathway in New Zealand and best-practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.",

An expanded understanding of the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical evaluation methods, sequelae, and empirically supported treatment options of common pediatric sleep disorders, especially in high-risk populations, is key to a rational approach to diagnosis and management of these children in clinical settings.",
21811133,,,,,"The clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy is usually uncomplicated in the presence of cataplexy. Objective testing is more important in ambiguous disease. The gold-standard objective test in these cases is the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Repeat testing can be burdensome but is reasonable when faced with a diagnostic dilemma. However, there is limited evidence to support this approach. In this study, we assessed the diagnostic utility of a repeat MSLT in patients suspected of narcolepsy whose first MSLT result was nonconfirmatory.

Of 125 patients who underwent an MSLT between 2004 and 2009, we identified 10 (9.6%) who had undergone repeat studies. We analyzed changes in MSLT parameters while taking account of other relevant differences between testing.

Two patients (20%) met narcolepsy criteria during the second MSLT. Nine patients (90%) met sleepiness criteria (mean sleep latency <8 minutes) during the second MSLT while only 5 did during the first (P = 0.05).

We demonstrate that a repeat MSLT confirmed the diagnosis of narcolepsy in 20% of patients whose results had been nonconfirmatory on a first MSLT. This study provides support for a repeat MSLT in cases where clinical suspicion for narcolepsy is high despite an ambiguous first test.",

On the occasion of a case series, we present an overview of the literature and discuss anatomical and embryological location, imaging characteristics, presenting symptoms, and treatment indication of these lesions.

We identified, in a retrospective study of a database with 81 patients harboring 86 supratentorial intracranial cysts, six patients with a CSF-containing cyst at the level of the choroidal fissure. In all cases, presenting symptoms were mild and the cysts were considered a fortuitous diagnosis. None of the patients was treated surgically, and the cysts remained stable at radiological follow-up. We performed a literature search for cerebral cysts and choroidal fissure cysts in particular.

Only one large study purely addressing choroidal fissure cysts was found in the literature.

CSF-containing cysts at the level of the choroidal fissure may be of the arachnoid or the neuroepithelial type, but pathological confirmation of a CSF-containing cyst at this specific location has never been published. Very infrequently they are symptomatic, and surgical treatment is hardly ever necessary.",

21543032,,,,,"Two cases of hypersomnia in children caused by therapeutic doses of oral clarithromycin are presented. Clarithromycin-induced hypersomnia in children has not been reported before. A 4-year-old girl and 13-year-old boy received clarithromycin as monotherapy. The girl fell into a deep sleep after every dose of the antibiotic. The boy reported daytime sleepiness and prolongation of night-time sleep during the antibiotic therapy. In both cases the hypersomnia receded after cessation of clarithromycin therapy. The onset of hypersomnia after clarithromycin intake, its remission once the drug was stopped, and the absence of other possible causative factors favored the diagnosis of clarithromycin-induced hypersomnia, further supported by the scores on Naranjo's Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale in both cases. Clinicians evaluating children receiving clarithromycin and exhibiting suddenly changed behavior should keep in mind that the antibiotic can produce uncommon adverse reactions.",
21532956,,,,,"To retrospectively describe childhood presentations of primary hypersomnia with an emphasis on narcolepsy-cataplexy in a Chinese population.

A total of 417 children (< 18 years old) successively presenting with complaints of hypersomnia without anatomic cause or sleep apnea risk were evaluated using the Stanford Sleep Inventory, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1*0602 typing, and MSLT recordings. CSF hypocretin-1 was measured in 47 cases to document hypocretin deficiency. A subgroup (""narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency"") with likely hypocretin deficiency (low hypocretin-1 or HLA positive with clear-cut cataplexy) was further examined for presentations prior to, around, or after puberty.

Narcolepsy with (n = 361) or without (n = 17) cataplexy presented at an earlier age and with increased male predominance when compared to idiopathic hypersomnia (n = 39, P < 0.01). Nearly 70% of those with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (n = 271) had disease onset before age 10 y, and 15% had onset before age 6, an unusually young age distribution. Onset was prior to puberty in 78% of cases. Clinical features were similar in presentations across puberty groups except for sleep paralysis, which increased in frequency with age/puberty. Mean sleep latency (MSL) decreased and the number of sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) increased with age/puberty, but MSLT diagnosis criteria (MSL ≤ 8 min, ≥ 2 SOREMPs) were similarly positive across groups. Familial clustering was present in only 1.7% of probands.

In children presenting with a complaint of primary hypersomnia to a sleep clinic in China, 86% (361/417) meet criteria for narcolepsy with cataplexy. Puberty did not affect positivity on the MSLT as a diagnostic feature. Sleep paralysis was the only symptom that increased with increasing age. In addition, narcolepsy with cataplexy in our clinic population appeared to begin at a younger age than usually reported in other studies.",
21358852,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and REM sleep abnormalities. A genome-wide association study identified a novel narcolepsy-related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs5770917, which is located adjacent to CPT1B (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B). In this study, we analyzed the CPT1B expression level and measured the carnitine fractions in blood samples obtained from narcolepsy patients and control subjects to test the hypothesis that fatty acid β-oxidation is altered in narcolepsy.

We measured CPT1B mRNA expression in white blood cells of 38 narcolepsy patients and 56 healthy control subjects. The serum carnitine fractions (total carnitine, free carnitine, and acylcarnitine) were measured in the 38 narcolepsy patients and in 30 of 56 control subjects. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the risk allele (C) for SNP rs5770917 was significantly associated with decreased CPT1B mRNA expression (P = 1.0 × 10(-9)), and the CPT1B expression was higher in the narcolepsy patients than in the controls (P = 0.005). The acylcarnitine levels were abnormally low in 21% of the narcolepsy patients while those of all the controls were within the normal range. Stepwise multiple regression analysis using the dichotomous variable for acylcarnitine (normal or abnormal) as an objective variable revealed that the diagnosis of narcolepsy but not CPT1B expression level and BMI was associated with abnormally low acylcarnitine levels (P = 0.006).

Our results indicate that multiple factors are involved in the regulation of serum acylcarnitine levels. Abnormally low levels of acylcarnitine observed in narcolepsy suggest dysfunctional fatty acid β-oxidation pathway.",
21345702,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a life-long disease characterized by abnormal regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and increased penetration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In children, narcolepsy without cataplexy is more frequently seen than in adults. The aim of our study was to evaluate clinical and polysomnographic parameters to verify if cataplexy appearing later in life can be foretold.

30 patients (12 boys), who contracted narcolepsy before the age of 18, were enrolled. All underwent clinical examination, nocturnal polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), HLA-DQB1∗0602 testing and, most of them Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) rating. The Mann-Whitney rank and Fisher's tests were used for statistical analysis.

Narcolepsy without cataplexy (NwC) was diagnosed in 40% of the patients. The mean age at the first symptoms was 14.0 ± 3.0, at diagnosis 15.6 ± 3.1 years. Narcolepsy was accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations in 15 and sleep paralysis in 12 patients. Frequent symptoms were sleep inertia during awakening, REM behavior symptoms, behavioral and serious school problems. BMI was higher in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy (N-C). A high ESS score was indicative of excessive daytime sleepiness (17.1 ± 2.5). Mean MSLT sleep latency was 4.0 ± 3.1 min with 3.2 ± 1.4 sleep onset REM periods (SOREMs) with no difference between the two study groups. HLA typing revealed no differences either. The N-C group showed a higher degree of wakefulness and superficial non-REM (NREM) stage 1 with a lower NREM stage 3 during PSG.

Narcolepsy in childhood leaves very little scope for the prediction of cataplexy later in life.",
21317035,,,,,"Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has been described predominantly in elderly men and in association with neurodegenerative disease. But an increasing proportion of cases in recent reports and in clinical practice do not fit this description; thus we sought to describe a current RBD population and possibly identify new subgroups with RBD.

Records of 115 consecutive patients with polysomnogram-confirmed RBD at an academic sleep center were retrospectively reviewed.

Male to female ratio was 2:1, and 1.25:1 for early-onset (age <50) cases. Mean age at diagnosis was 53.7±16.4years. Most (60%) cases were idiopathic, and neurodegenerative disease was coincident primarily in older men. Autoimmune disease was unexpectedly common in women (20%) particularly in the 30-49 age groups (40%). Antidepressant use was frequent (46.1%), especially in early-onset cases (57.8%).

RBD is diagnosed more equally between men and women and in younger individuals than previously reported. While neurodegenerative disease is frequently co-incident with RBD in older men, most women and early-onset cases have ""idiopathic"" RBD. High prevalence of autoimmune disease among women with RBD suggests an intriguing link between immune dysfunction and RBD. A high rate of antidepressant use provides support for a potentially causal role for antidepressants in RBD.",
21302860,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a disorder of children and adolescence, but until recently it was often not identified until adulthood, with a reported time from onset to diagnosis of about a decade. This disorder affects approximately 0.05% of the population and starts in childhood and adolescence about half of the time. With narcolepsy, the boundaries between wake, sleep, and dreams are blurred. The cardinal features of narcolepsy-cataplexy are daytime somnolence, cataplexy (sometimes occurring long after onset of sleepiness), sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Weight gain, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and social/school functional changes are common; reactive substance use to maintain wakefulness during the day may also be seen. Males and females are equally affected. It is classically associated with HLA DQB1*0602, the most specific genetic marker for narcolepsy across all ethnic groups. CSF hypocretin has recently been found to be depleted in this disorder, and late-breaking data support that the disease is caused by autoimmune destruction of hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus. There is no known cure for narcolepsy. Therapies include behavioral/ scheduling modification, medications to combat daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, and treatment of concomitant disorders leading to daytime sleepiness. The differential diagnosis for this disorder should include other disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness with a proclivity toward onset in adolescence, such as delayed sleep phase syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and insufficient sleep time; substance use; and less commonly neurologic disorders such as Klein Levin syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and others. Immunomodulator therapy and hypocretin replacement are proposed therapies that hold promise for the future.",
21302858,,,,,"Sleep disorders are highly prevalent during childhood and adolescence. It is known that if left untreated, these problems can have significant impact on daytime function, including learning, memory, attention, and behavior. The approach to the treatment of these disorders (whether with or without pharmacotherapy) is dependent on a thorough evaluation of the sleep complaint and determination of an accurate diagnosis. Many pediatric sleep problems are due to insomnia. There is good evidence that young children with behaviorally based insomnia respond to appropriate behavioral interventions. There is less research evidence of the efficacy of these interventions in children who are either school age or adolescents; however, nonpharmacologic strategies are usually indicated initially in the approach to treatment. The indication for the use of pharmacotherapy in pediatric insomnia is not well understood; however, some general principles are described when medications may be considered. There are specific sleep disorders (other than insomnia) for which pharmacotherapy plus behavioral strategies are warranted. The research regarding pharmacotherapy in pediatric sleep disorders is limited; often, medications are used ""off label"" based on data extrapolated from adult studies. Clinicians who suggest over-the-counter treatments or prescribe medications for pediatric patients with sleep disorders should have an understanding of the classification of sleep disorders and the role of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of these disorders. In this chapter, the emphasis is on the pharmacologic treatment of sleep disorders in typically developing children and adolescents.",

The protocol included the following: Epworth, Ullanlinna narcolepsy scale, and Stanford cataplexy questionnaires; physical, psychological and neurological examinations; neuroimaging; PSG+MSLT recordings; HLA and in two cases Hcrt-1 level in CSF.

Narcolepsy was sporadic in all cases. The first symptom was EDS with a mean age at onset of 9.4±2.5 years (range 6-13 years). All patients complained of cataplexy. Other symptoms were hypnagogic hallucinations (4 children) and sleep paralysis (3 children). All the children performed poorly at school, 4 had emotional disorders with depression, 4 displayed nocturnal eating and weight gain. Mean BMI was 25.0 kg/m(2). One girl was diagnosed as having precocious puberty, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. The MRI showed a partial empty sella. Hcrt-1 was undetectable in her CSF. The mean Ullanlinna score was 24.6; PSG showed disturbed nocturnal sleep and the MSLT showed a mean sleep latency of 2.1 min and 3 SOREMPs. Eight children were DR2-DQ1-positive, whereas one boy was DR2-negative but DQ1-positive. In two patients, Hcrt-1 was undetectable. All children, in addition to scheduled naps during the day, were treated with modafinil or methylphenidate combined with an antidepressant and in two cases with sodium oxybate.

NC was sporadic in all children and associated with precocious puberty and PCOS, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance in one case. EDS, cataplexy, disturbed nocturnal sleep, nocturnal eating, poor school performance, and emotional disorders were the principal complaints. All patients had DQB1∗0602 and Hcrt-1 was evaluated in two cases (undetectable in both).",
21040601,,,,,"Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a neurotransmitter that occurs naturally in the brain and is increasingly being used as a 'party drug' because of its relaxing and euphoria-inducing effects. GHB has a limited medical use in the treatment of narcolepsy. GHB-intoxications occur often in non-medical use, and generally result in a coma of short duration. GHB use several times a day can lead to tolerance and dependence. After sudden cessation or reduction of intensive GHB use, a severe withdrawal syndrome may occur with symptoms varying from tremor, anxiety and agitation to autonomic instability, hallucinations and delirium. Treatment of the GHB withdrawal syndrome consists of supportive care and benzodiazepines, often in high doses. The controlled detoxification of GHB using pharmaceutical GHB in an adjusted dose is currently being investigated in the Netherlands. There is no literature concerning the treatment of patients following GHB intoxication or after detoxification.",
21037131,,,,,"The authors describe and discuss a syndrome of transient psychogenic weakness usually mistaken for cataplexy but which has a close association with a depressive mental state. Four patients were referred to the authors with suspected neurological causes of transient weakness, including cataplexy in three cases, for whom the eventual diagnosis was of a functional or psychogenic motor disorder, related in most cases to depression. This variety of transient functional weakness is related to conditions such as nonepileptic attack disorder, persistent functional weakness, catatonia, and depressive motor retardation. These cases point to the existence of a syndrome of transient motor weakness which resembles cataplexy and has features in common with other forms of mood induced psychogenic weakness such as psychomotor retardation and catatonia. Psychogenic ""pseudocataplexy"" is a diagnostic consideration in patients with atypical cataplexy, especially in the context of mood disturbance. Despite its close resemblance to cataplexy, pseudocataplexy has a different pathogenesis and requires a different approach to management.",

Armodafinil-naïve, adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with treated OSA (n = 170), SWD (n = 108), or narcolepsy (n = 50) received armodafinil (100-250 mg) once daily (treated OSA or narcolepsy) or before night shifts (SWD). Patients with OSA were regular users of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).

Across the diagnosis groups, the most commonly occurring adverse event was headache (14%-24%). Forty-three patients (13%) and 13 patients (4%) were withdrawn because of adverse events and insufficient efficacy, respectively. Armodafinil did not adversely affect CPAP therapy. At the final visit, 80% (95% CI: 74.1, 86.7) of patients with treated OSA and 84% (72.7, 94.8) of patients with narcolepsy were rated on the CGI-I as at least minimally improved with regard to overall clinical condition; 98% (95.2, 100.0) of patients with SWD were rated as improved with regard to sleepiness during night shifts, including the commute to and from work. Armodafinil improved ESS total scores in patients with treated OSA (mean [SD] [95% CI] change from baseline, -7.3 [5.6] [-8.39, -6.30]) and patients with narcolepsy (-4.7 [6.0] [-7.41, -1.93]).

ZDS score (inversely) and duration of disease (directly) explained a percentage of variance of role physical, vitality (VT), social functioning (SF) and role emotional. At the second observation VT and SF had a further percentage of variance explained by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and age at onset. Self-reported diabetes frequency doubled after 5 years (from 7% to 17%).

NPC has a very heterogenous clinical presentation from perinatal period to adulthood. The perinatal presentation is visceral. In the early-infantile, late-infantile and juvenile period, a wide range of aspecific and progressive neurologic symptoms varies according to the age at onset, but four signs have a great diagnostic value : prolonged neonatal cholestasis, splenomegaly, cataplexy and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. The diagnosis confirmation requires a fibroblast culture and molecular genetic testing of NPC1 and NPC2 genes. The recent approval of a specific treatment, reducing neurological disease progression, makes essential an early diagnosis of NPC.",
20585744,,,,,"This manuscript contains the conclusion of the consensus meeting on the diagnosis of narcolepsy based on the review of Medline publications between 1980-2010. Narcolepsy is a chronic disorder with age at onset between the first and second decade of life. Essential narcolepsy symptoms are cataplexy and excessive sleepiness. Cataplexy is defined as sudden, recurrent and reversible attacks of muscle weakness triggered by emotions. Accessory narcolepsy symptoms are hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and nocturnal fragmented sleep. The clinical diagnosis according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders is the presence of excessive sleepiness and cataplexy. A full in-lab polysomnography followed by a multiple sleep latency test is recommended for the confirmation of the diagnosis and co-morbidities. The presence of two sleep-onset REM period naps in the multiple sleep latency test is diagnostic for cataplexy-free narcolepsy. A positive HLA-DQB1*0602 with lower than 110pg/mL level of hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid is required for the final diagnosis of cataplexy- and sleep-onset REM period -free narcolepsy.",
20518604,,,,,"Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as excessive daytime sleepiness, 'sleep attacks', insomnia, restless legs syndrome and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, are common and provide a challenge to treatment. These sleep symptoms are also described in patients suffering from the sleep/wake disorder, narcolepsy. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) narcolepsy criteria uses a number of markers for diagnosis, of which lack or deficiency of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels is a key marker. Hypocretin neurons prominently located in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical nucleus have been proposed to interact with mechanisms involving sleep and arousal. Low hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF have been shown to correlate with hypothalamic hypocretin cell loss in narcolepsy and other forms of hypersomnia; therefore, it has been proposed that degenerative damage to hypocretin neurons (such as in PD) may be detected by low CSF hypocretin-1 concentrations, and may also explain the sleep symptoms experienced by some PD patients. To date, there is mixed conflicting data describing hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF of patients with parkinsonism associated with sleep symptoms, with most studies showing no significant decrease when compared with controls. However, hypocretin-1 CSF deficiency has been shown in some studies to be more prominent in PD patients with sleep symptoms versus those without. Notably, the hypocretin system has been shown not to be selectively disrupted, with one study showing melanin concentrating hormone cell loss in the same patients with hypocretin loss. It is likely that hypocretin deficiency in PD patients occurs secondary to collateral damage caused by the neurodegenerative process involving the hypothalamus. Awareness of narcoleptic events in PD is important for driving related advice, in addition to the possible use of dopamine D3 receptor active agonists.",

It is currently believed to be caused by a deficiency in hypocretin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Diagnosis is by the presence of appropriate clinical symptoms and confirmation by a polysomnogram followed by a multiple sleep latency test. There are nonpharmacologic (eg, scheduled naps, following proper sleep hygiene) and symptom-directed pharmacologic (eg, central nervous system stimulants, modafinil, sodium oxybate, certain antidepressants) treatments that are usually used together for optimal management of narcolepsy.",

We suspect this is higher than presently seen in the Republic of Ireland. We aimed to calculate the Irish prevalence of Narcolepsy and to examine current management practices. We conducted an online survey of respiratory physicians, neurologists, paediatric neurologists, and psychiatrists with an interest in sleep disorders (73% response rate). Of this group, a total of 16 physicians managed 180 patients prior to January 2009. A clinical diagnosis alone was reached in 67 (41%) patients, the remainder by polysomnography or multiple sleep latency testing. No patients were diagnosed by cerebro-spinal fluid analysis of hypocretin levels. While 70 (42%) patients received modafanil, only 7 (4%) were treated with sodium oxybate. Even allowing for missing data it is apparent that Narcolepsy is hugely under-diagnosed in Ireland, however, current practises adhere with new international guidelines.",
20480724,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a rare but disabling condition that causes excessive daytime sleepiness. Interestingly, weight gain is frequent in patients with narcolepsy and it has sometimes been described very early in the course of the disease. Here, we report four consecutive obese children who were referred to our sleep laboratory for excessive daytime sleepiness and suspected sleep apnoea syndrome. They underwent nocturnal polysomnography associated with multiple sleep latency tests. Narcolepsy was diagnosed in all children with a close temporal link between the onset of narcolepsy, obesity and puberty. Scientifically, the relationship between sleep, weight, growth rate and puberty onset is striking and merits further investigation. From the clinical point of view, narcolepsy must be investigated in obese sleepy children along with obstructive sleep apnoea. Indeed, it can be controlled with appropriate treatment but the proper diagnosis relies not only upon nocturnal polysomnography but involves the systematic use of multiple sleep latency tests.",
20308759,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a neurologic illness that typically begins in the second and third decades of life. It is chronic in nature and negatively impacts the quality of life of affected patients. The classic presentation is a tetrad of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. The exact cause remains unknown, but there is significant evidence that hypocretin deficiency plays an integral role. Some primary conditions that result in secondary narcolepsy include traumatic brain injury, congenital disorders, tumours, and strokes. Some medical and psychiatric disorders share characteristics of narcolepsy, at times leading to diagnostic inaccuracy. Other sleep disorders are commonly co-morbid. Diagnosis relies on patient history and objective data gathered from polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. Treatment focuses on symptom relief through medication, education, and behavioural modification. Both classic pharmacological treatments as well as newer options have significant problems, especially because of side effects and abuse potential. Novel modalities are being examined to expand options for treatment.",
20207562,,,,,"Cataplexy is the sudden muscle weakness brought on by strong emotions, particularly joking, laughter, or anger. Cataplexy may involve only certain group of muscles or the entire voluntary musculature. In rare cases, symptoms of cataplexy can be seen during the course of some inherited diseases (Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), Prader-Willi syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Norrie disease). We report the successful use of miglustat, a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, approved for use in Gaucher's disease, and which catalyses the first step in the biosynthesis of most glycosphingolipid, in a boy with NPC with cataplexy. A 9-year-old boy was admitted for assessments of frequent ""drop attacks"" while laughing. The filipin fluorescence tests of cultured skin fibroblasts revealed massive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, confirming the diagnosis of NPC disease. Molecular studies confirmed the diagnosis of NPC too. After approval from the bioethics committee, miglustat was initiated on the child at 100mg three times a day. Cataplectic attacks disappeared completely after 6 months on treatment, and patient continues to be in remission from the cataplectic attacks at 16 months follow-up. There was no further progression of neurological signs or symptoms or splenomegaly, with some improvement in cognitive function as well as social, affective and attention problems, up-gaze, and gait. Miglustat was well tolerated with no side effects observed. In summary, this is the first report of miglustat treatment of cataplexy in NPC. Long-term follow-up for continuing efficacy and tolerability in a larger cohort with NPC is needed to substantiate our observation.",
20175400,,,,,"The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) criteria for low CSF hypocretin-1 levels (CSF hcrt-1) still need validation as a diagnostic tool for narcolepsy in different populations because inter-assay variability and different definitions of hypocretin deficiency complicate direct comparisons of study results.

Interviews, polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test, HLA-typing, and CSF hcrt-1 measurements in Danish patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) and narcolepsy without cataplexy (NwC), CSF hcrt-1 measurements in other hypersomnias, neurological and normal controls. Comparisons of hypocretin deficiency and frequency of HLA-DQB1*0602-positivity in the Danish and eligible NC and NwC populations (included via MEDLINE search), by (re)calculation of study results using the ICSD-2 criterion for low CSF hcrt-1 (< 30% of normal mean).

In Danes, low CSF hcrt-1 was present in 40/46 NC, 3/14 NwC and 0/106 controls (P < 0.0001). Thirty-nine of 41 NC and 4/13 NwC patients were HLA-DQB1*0602-positive (P < 0.01). Hypocretin-deficient NC patients had higher frequency of cataplexy, shorter mean sleep latency, more sleep onset REM periods (P < 0.05) and more awakenings (NS) than did NC patients with normal CSF hcrt-1. Across populations, low CSF hcrt-1 and HLA-DQB1*0602-positivity characterized the majority of NC (80% to 100%, P = 0.53; 80% to 100%, P = 0.11) but a minority of NwC patients (11% to 29%, P = 0.75; 29% to 89%, P = 0.043).

The study provides evidence that hypocretin deficiency causes a more severe NC phenotype. The ICSD-2 criterion for low CSF hcrt-1 (< 30% of normal mean) is valid for diagnosing NC, but not NwC. HLA-typing should precede CSF hcrt-1 measurements because hypocretin deficiency is rare in HLA-DQB1*0602-negative patients.",
20159196,,,,,"Child and adolescent catatonia has been poorly investigated. Moreover, diagnosis criteria only exist for adult psychiatry, and there are no therapeutic guidelines. The aim of this paper is to describe the case of a 14-year-old girl presenting an overlap between psychogenic and neuroleptic induced catatonia, acute treatment and ten year's follow-up.

A 14-year-old Caucasian French girl, Elsa, was admitted in February 1998 to a University adolescent mental health center with an acute psychotic disorder. She showed agitation, impulsivity (sudden engagement in inappropriate behaviour), paranoid delusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, diurnal and nocturnal urinary incontinence, lack of self-care, inadequate food intake because of fear of poisoning, and vomiting after meals leading to rapid weight loss of 5 kg. Clinical examination, laboratory tests, EEG and RMI were normal. Toxicological tests were negative. Her IQ, assessed six months before admission, was in the dull average range (70-75). Elsa was treated with loxapine 150 mg per day for one week without improvement and this was then replaced by haloperidol 30 mg per day. One week after the start of haloperidol her agitation, impulsivity, and hallucinatory symptoms decreased. Twenty four days after loxapine introduction and 17 days after the haloperidol, her condition deteriorated rapidly over less than 48 hours. She exhibited immobility, minimal response to stimuli, staring and catalepsy with waxy flexibility. The diagnosis of catatonia was established. Examination revealed tremulous extremities, tachychardia (110 pm) and apyrexia. Creatine phosphokinase levels were 106 UI/l (normal range 0-250). Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, listeria and Lyme serology were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Haloperidol was stopped and intravenous clonazepam 5mg/kg was begun. It was not possible to obtain signed consent from the two parents for Electroconvulsive therapy. The patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit. The treatment was standard parenteral nutrition, nursing, intravenous clonazepam 0.05 mg/kg, with regular attendance by a child psychiatrist. Elsa stayed three weeks in this condition. She then began to notice the child psychiatrist, and a few days later she was able to carry out simple requests. Elsa was transferred to an adolescent psychiatric unit. As soon as she could eat by herself again, carbamazepine 400mg per day was begun. Her agitation reduced at a carbamazepine level of 7 mg/l. One month later her condition was stable. However, language difficulties persisted for a further six months. One year after the episode she scored 66 on a repeat IQ test and her RMI was normal. She exhibited no significant residual symptoms except some cognitive impairment. She integrated into a special education facility. These attempts to stop the carbamazepine were followed by depressed mood, aggressiveness and impulsivity; carbamazepine was finally stopped successfully after seven years. Ten years later, Elsa is the mother of two young children and is able to take care of them. She has never had a relapse of her psychotic disorder or catatonic state.

The etiopathogenic diagnosis is problematic. Some indices in the familial history may suggest a traumatic event. But one to the total residual amnesia it was never confirmed, and traumatic catatonia are extremely rare. Normal CPK levels, with autonomic disturbance limited to tachycardia and the lack of resolution after discontinuance of medication, argues against a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). But CPK levels are non specific, and NMS without pyrexia has been described. The occurrence of the catatonic syndrome 21 days after the first dose of a neuroleptic could be diagnostic. This case involved a non organic catatonic psychosis followed by neuroleptic induced catatonia. Catatonia is described as a risk factor for the development of NMS and some consider NMS to be a variant of malignant catatonia. The interest of this report is (1) it reinforces the need to be cautious before prescribing neuroleptics in adolescents presenting with symptoms of catatonia; (2) the complete recovery from catatonia after treatment with intensive care and more than three weeks of intravenous clonazepam without the use of ECT and (3) the effectiveness of carbamazepine over a long period of follow-up. Although trials on carbamazepine in catatonia are published, there are no data available for the control of residual symptoms or the long term prognosis, especially in child and adolescent psychiatry.",
20120618,,,,,"To investigate associations between HLA-DQB1*0602 allele status and measures of narcolepsy symptom severity.

Cross-sectional study of population-based narcolepsy patients.

King County, Washington.

All prevalent cases (n = 279) of physician-diagnosed narcolepsy ascertained from 2001-2005.

N/A.

Narcolepsy diagnosis was based on cataplexy status, diagnostic sleep study results, and chart review. The number of HLA-DQB1 alleles was determined from buccal genomic DNA. Symptom severity instruments included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS), age of symptom onset, subjective sleep latency and duration, and various clinical sleep parameters. We used linear regression adjusted for African American race and an extended chi-square test of trend to assess relationships across ordered groups defined by allele number (0, 1, or 2).

Narcolepsy patients were 63% female and 82% Caucasian, with a mean age of 47.6 years (SD = 17.1). One hundred forty-one (51%) patients had no DQB1*0602 alleles; 117 (42%) had one; and 21 (7%) had two. In the complete narcolepsy sample after adjustment for African American race, we observed a linear relationship between HLA-DQB1*0602 frequency and sleepiness as defined by the ESS (P < 0.01), narcolepsy severity as defined by UNS (P < 0.001), age of symptom onset (P < 0.05), and sleep latency (P < 0.001). In univariate analyses, HLA-DQB1*0602 frequency was also associated with napping (P < 0.05) and increased car and work accidents or near accidents (both P < 0.01). Habitual sleep duration was not associated with HLA status. These race-adjusted associations remained for the ESS (P < 0.05), UNS (P < 0.01), and sleep latency (P < 0.001) when restricting to narcolepsy with cataplexy.

Narcolepsy symptom severity varies in a linear manner according to HLA-DQB1*0602 allele status. These findings support the notion that HLA-DQ is a disease-modifying gene.",
20114128,,,,,"Narcolepsy is a primary sleeping disorder with excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy as core symptoms. There is increasing interest in the psychiatric phenotype of narcolepsy. Although many authors suggest an overrepresentation of mood disorders, few systematic studies have been performed and conflicting results have been reported. Anxiety disorders in narcolepsy have only received little attention.

We performed a case-control study in 60 narcolepsy patients and 120 age- and sex-matched controls from a previous population study. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry were used to assess symptoms and diagnostic classifications of mood and anxiety disorders.

Symptoms of mood disorders were reported by about one third of patients. However, the prevalence of formal mood disorder diagnoses - including major depression - was not increased. In contrast, more than half of the narcolepsy patients had anxiety or panic attacks. Thirty-five percent of the patients could be diagnosed with anxiety disorder (odds ratio=15.6), with social phobia being the most important diagnosis. There was no influence of age, sex, duration of illness or medication use on the prevalence of mood or anxiety symptoms and disorders.

Anxiety disorders, especially panic attacks and social phobias, often affect patients with narcolepsy. Although symptoms of mood disorders are present in many patients, the prevalence of major depression is not increased. Anxiety and mood symptoms could be secondary complications of the chronic symptoms of narcolepsy. Recent studies have shown that narcolepsy is caused by defective hypocretin signaling. As hypocretin neurotransmission is also involved in stress regulation and addiction, this raises the possibility that mood and anxiety symptoms are primary disease phenomena in narcolepsy.",
20069207,,,,,"To determine the correlations between excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), assessed by the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and nocturnal sleep architecture features, clinical symptoms of narcolepsy (CSN) and subjective sleep quality (SSQ) in patients with narcolepsy.

Twenty three untreated patients were studied and compared with a matched control group. Diagnosis of narcolepsy was carried out employing a clinical interview, a polysomnographic (PSG) record, and an MSLT.

Subjective number of awakenings was the SSQ indicator that best correlated with EDS (ESS and MSLT). Regarding clinical features, diurnal tiredness and sleep paralysis correlated with ESS values. Increase in ESS was related with decrease in total sleep time, SWS, and sleep onset latency. On the other hand, increase in MSLT was related with decrease in SWS.

These data suggest that EDS in patients with narcolepsy could be impaired by disturbed nocturnal sleep.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) in consecutive patients with narcolepsy referred to our sleep disorders centre.

Among patients examined because of hypersomnia, a diagnosis of narcolepsy was established in 30 patients (mean age 34.1 +/-13.6; 13 females, 17 males) on the basis of clinical features, polysomnography (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Polysomnographic analysis included assessment of muscle activity during REM sleep, recorded from chin and anterior tibialis muscles. Video recordings were reviewed for intense motor activity during REM periods, manifested as excessive, violent body movements (especially legs) and vocalization, reflecting dream-enacting behaviour. Questions about RBD symptoms were asked as a standard in all newly diagnosed patients and those reporting for follow-up visits.

Symptomatic, polysomnographically documented RBD was found in three patients. In one of them RBD symptoms appeared during anticataplectic treatment with antidepressive medications. Disturbances of muscle tone regulation during REM sleep without clinical symptoms were found in polysomnography in a further four patients. Among patients reporting for follow-up visits, three subjects confirmed clinical symptoms corresponding to RBD of various severity.

RBD occurs in narcolepsy more frequently than it was previously considered. Questions about symptoms of this disorder that may be injurious for the patient or patient's bed partner should be routinely asked during the clinical interview.",

Discussion on REM and NREM sleep, its phases and alternating share according to child's age was conducted. Sleep disorders were in accordance with their international classification. Parasomnias, occupying most of the space, were divided in two groups: primary and secondary. Among primary parasomnias disorders associated with falling asleep (sleep myoclonus, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome) are important. Another disorders are parasomians associated with light NREM sleep (bruxism, periodic limb movement disorder) and with deeper NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnabulism, night terrors), with REM sleep (nightmares, REM sleep behavior disorder) and associated with NREM and REM sleep (catathrenia, sleep enuresis, sleep talking). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and epileptic seizures occurring during sleep also play an important role. Frontal lobe epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome should be considered in the first place in such cases. Our 4 cases document these diagnostic difficulties, requiring video/polysomnography examination 2 of them illustrate frontal lobe epilepsy and single ones myoclonic epilepsy graphy in children is a difficult technique and requires special device, local and trained personnel.

Establishing the proper diagnosis is very important, because of the negative impact of narcolepsy on patients' functioning in social-life and the possibility of improvement of quality of life with adequate treatment.

Present review describes clinical characteristics of narcolepsy, usefulness of neurophysiological tests in differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and assessing the efficacy of the treatment, as well as the application of novel biological methods in diagnosis of narcolepsy.

According to diagnostic criteria of ICSD-2 the diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on the clinical features and diagnostic examinations and tests. Among them neurophysiological procedures, such as polysomnography (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are still recommended as most useful in differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias. In recent decades novel biochemical and genetic tools have been developed as diagnostic measures in narcolepsy, including the levels of hypocretin in cerebral spinal fluid and HLA DQB1*0602 typing. These both biological markers are strongly associated with the occurrence of cataplexy, therefore do not present considerable diagnostic value in narcolepsy without cataplexy.

Narcolepsy may have serious negative effects on health-, social-, education-, and work-related issues for people with narcolepsy and for their families. The disease may, thus, present a significant socioeconomic burden, but no studies to date have addressed the indirect and direct costs of narcolepsy.

Using records from the Danish National Patient Registry (1998-2005), we identified 459 Danish patients with the diagnosis of narcolepsy. Using a ratio of 1 patient record to 4 control subjects' records, we then compared the information of patients with narcolepsy with that of 1836 records from age- and sex-matched, randomly chosen citizens in the Danish Civil Registration System Statistics. We calculated the annual direct and indirect health costs, including labor supply and social transfer payments (which include income derived from state coffers, such as subsistence allowances, pensions, social security, social assistance, public personal support for education, etc.). Direct costs included frequencies and costs of hospitalizations and weighted outpatient use, according to diagnosis-related groups, and specific outpatient costs based on data from The Danish Ministry of Health. The use of and costs of drugs were based on data from the Danish Medicines Agency. The frequencies and costs from primary sectors were based on data from The National Health Security. Indirect costs were based on income data derived from data from the Coherent Social Statistics.

Patients with narcolepsy had significantly higher rates of health-related contact and medication use and higher expenses, as compared with control subjects. They also had higher unemployment rates. The income level of patients with narcolepsy who were employed was lower than that of employed control subjects. The annual total direct and indirect costs were euro 11,654 (euro = Eurodollars) for patients with narcolepsy and euro 1430 for control subjects (p < 0.001), corresponding to an annual mean excess health-related cost of euro 10,223 for each patient with narcolepsy.

Metabolic parameters were evaluated by measuring body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (also with abdominal computed tomography), blood pressure, and daily calorie intake (3-day diary). Chronotypes were assessed through the morningness-eveningness questionnaire. Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A determination and HLA typing were performed. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (all HLA DQB1*0602 positive and with cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A levels < 110 pg/mL) had a higher BMI and BMI-independent metabolic alterations, namely waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose/insulin ratio (an insulin resistance index), with respect to patients with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time (cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A levels > 300 pg/mL). Despite lower daily food intake, patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy displayed significant alterations in metabolic parameters resulting in a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in more than half the cases.

BMI-independent metabolic alterations and the relative hypophagia of patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, as compared with patients with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time, suggest that orexin-A influences the etiology of this phenotype.

Other symptoms frequently reported are sleep paralysis (feeling of being unable to move or speak, even totally aware), hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid dreamlike experiences difficult to distinguish from reality) or disturbed night time sleep. Some children also experience depression or overweight-obesity. Although narcolepsy has been thoroughly studied, the exact cause is unknown. It appears to be a disorder of cerebral pathways that control sleep and wakefulness, involving dorsolateral hypothalamus and hypocretin. A genetic factor has been suggested, but narcolepsy in relatives is rare. Researchers have suggested that a set of genes combines with additional factors in a person's life to cause narcolepsy. The effective treatment of narcolepsy requires not only medication (usually stimulants, antidepressants and sodium oxybate), but also adjustments in life-style (scheduled naps). Management of this condition in children demands a comprehensive approach to the patient, that includes a correct diagnosis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment and adjustments in the environment. These strategies can improve the child's self-esteem and ability to obtain a good education.",2009.0

Recent insights in pathophysiology have demonstrated that narcolepsy-cataplexy is caused by early loss of hypothalamus hypocretin neurons. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying sleepiness and the dramatic cataplexy reaction to positive emotion remain unclear.

Twenty-one patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 21 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Diagnosis of narcolepsy was fully confirmed by polysomnography, HLA DQB1*0602 and CSF hypocretin levels (n=9). Seven patients were free of all drugs, and 14 were treated with psychostimulant and/or anticataplectic drugs. (18)-F-fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography procedures were performed at baseline in all subjects and during cataplexy attacks (n=2).

The authors found significant hypermetabolism in narcolepsy-cataplexy in fully awake condition in the limbic cortex specifically in the anterior and mid cingulate cortex, in the right cuneus and lingual gyrus. In contrast, no hypometabolism was found. Hypermetabolism was detected in the cerebellum and pre-postcentral gyri in treated compared with untreated patients. During cataplectic attacks, cerebral metabolism significantly increased in the bilateral pre-postcentral gyri, primary somatosensory cortex, with a marked decrease in the hypothalamus.

Hypermetabolism was found in the executive network in narcolepsy at baseline in fully awake condition. Wake state assessment during scanning appears critical to avoid results showing altered functional neurocircuitry secondary to sleepiness and not to the underlying neurological disorder per se. Finally, cataplexy attacks were characterised by a hypometabolism in the hypothalamus associated with wide bilateral brain area hypermetabolisms.",2010.0

Many patients with hypersomnia are diagnosed too late. The article presents a review of this field.

Sources are literature identified through a non-systematic Pub-Med search and the authors' personal experience with diagnosing and treating patients with narcolepsy and other hypersomnias.

Sleep attacks and emotionally triggered loss of muscle tone are the most important symptoms of narcolepsy with cataplexy. Loss of hypocretin-producing cells is considered to be the cause. Absence of the tissue antigen HLA DQB1*0602 renders narcolepsy an unlikely diagnosis. Narcolepsy without cataplexy occurs less frequently and may have another biological basis. A differential diagnostic evaluation is important to determine whether hypersomnia is associated with obstructive sleep apnea, neurological disease or psychiatric disorders. Polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests are important diagnostic tools. Hypocretine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid should be measured in most patients. Methylphenidate and other CNS-stimulants are the most potent drugs for treatment of sleep attacks. Tricyclic antidepressive drugs and some newer drugs may be efficient in cataplexy.

Narcolepsy may affect education and work-life. Medication is available. Regular general practitioners should refer patients suspected of having narcolepsy for evaluation in a sleep centre or a hospital with established routines for diagnosis of sleep disorders.",2009.0

They may coexist in the same patient but the frequency of this association and its clinical significance is unknown. The presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a narcoleptic patient may interfere with the diagnosis of narcolepsy. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of OSA in narcolepsy.

University hospital sleep clinic series of narcoleptic patients diagnosed with nocturnal polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test. Patients were systematically interviewed evaluating narcoleptic and OSAS features and their response to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment when applied.

One hundred and thirty-three patients with narcolepsy.

Thirty-three patients (24.8%) had an apnea-hypopnea index greater than 10 with a mean index of 28.5+/-15.7. Ten of them were initially diagnosed only with OSAS and the diagnosis of narcolepsy was delayed 6.1+/-7.8years until being evaluated in our center for residual EDS after CPAP therapy. In the remaining 23 patients, narcolepsy and OSA were diagnosed simultaneously. Cataplexy occurred with similar frequency in both groups. EDS did not improve in 11 of the 14 patients who were treated with CPAP. The presence of OSA was associated with male gender, older age and higher body mass index.

OSA occurs frequently in narcolepsy and may delay the diagnosis of narcolepsy by several years and interfere with its proper management. In patients with OSA, cataplexy should be actively looked for to exclude the presence of narcolepsy. Treatment with CPAP does not usually improve EDS in narcoleptics with OSA.",2010.0

This finding is in accordance with those of previous studies. The gold standard exam of narcolepsy with cataplexy is Hypocretin-1 dosage, but in patients without cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia, there are no specific diagnostic lab findings.

It is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and other rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-associated manifestations (eg, hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The recognition of this disorder is usually delayed by 10 to 15 years, largely because of its protean manifestations, insidious nature, and lack of physician awareness. Delayed diagnosis is associated with poor quality of life, depression, and increased likelihood of accidents. Health care providers should include narcolepsy in the differential diagnosis of patients with excessive sleepiness, chronic fatigue, sleep-disordered breathing, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Narcolepsy is a lifelong disorder that often requires pharmacological treatments, which may include wake-promoting stimulants for excessive sleepiness and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (sodium oxybate) and antidepressants for REM sleep-associated manifestations. This article presents a case of a 47-year-old man with long-standing sleepiness and cataplexy who was eventually diagnosed with narcolepsy 30 years after the first onset of symptoms. The presenting manifestations of narcolepsy, diagnostic criteria, and its management are also discussed.",2009.0

High tau protein in combination with low amyloid beta levels has a high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (90%) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) against normal aging and can predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD. The detection of 14-3-3 has a high sensitivity (80-90%) and specificity (90%) for the diagnosis of CJD. Low or undetectable CSF hypocretin-1 (orexin-1) levels constitute a diagnostic biomarker for narcolepsy with cataplexy. Detection of beta-2-transferrin indicates CSF contamination in oto- and rhinorrhoe with a sensitivity of > 79% at a specificity of 95% similar to the beta-trace protein (sensitivity > 90%, specificity 100%). However, beta-trace protein is faster and cheaper to perform. Possible future biomarkers are: elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor are relatively sensitive (51-100%) and specific (73-100%) for leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors and are associated with a poor prognosis in this condition.

Dynamic detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) was applied to electroencephalograms recorded during multiple sleep latency tests of 11 drug-free narcoleptic patients (19.3+/-4.4 yrs; 8 males) and 9 healthy controls (23.8+/-6.3 yrs; 6 males). The SOP of each group was estimated by fitting the time courses of the DFA scaling exponents to a parametric curve.

The sequence of DFA exponents showed that electrophysiological brain activity was changing rapidly across the SOP. This transition was also verified by a conventional method (i.e., dynamic spectral analysis). The SOP durations of narcoleptics and controls were estimated as 239+/-25 s and 145+/-20 s, respectively.

The significantly larger SOP of narcoleptics, compared to controls, is consistent with the wake state of narcolepsy being more susceptible to sleep due to a lower barrier to transitioning to sleep.

Our results suggest that electrophysiological signatures of narcolepsy could be quantified by dynamic DFA, so the method may have promise as a potential tool to help the diagnosis of narcolepsy despite the present study's limited sample size.",2009.0

It is not known whether subjects with narcolepsy (who frequently have associated RBD) also show SN hyperechogenicity. The aim of this study was to (1) evaluate SN echogenicity in narcolepsy and (2) determine whether transcranial sonography (TCS) differs in narcoleptic subjects with and without RBD. A total of 16 patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy (7 had a concomitant, video-polysomnographically based diagnosis of RBD) were examined with TCS by two investigators blinded to the clinical data. The size of the SN echogenic area in both subgroups was within the range previously described for healthy subjects. The brainstem raphe, however, was reduced in five of seven narcoleptic subjects with RBD, whereas only two of nine narcoleptic subjects without RBD exhibited this TCS finding. We conclude that evaluation of SN echogenicity does not discriminate between both subgroups. The absence of SN hyperechogenicity in narcoleptic patients with RBD supports the hypothesis that SN hyperechogenicity in patients with presumed idiopathic RBD is an additional risk marker for subsequent evolvement of PD rather than an RBD-immanent finding. Reduced echogenicity of the brainstem raphe might indicate an involvement of the serotonergic system in narcoleptic subjects with RBD.",2009.0

Narcolepsy is a chronic rapid eye movement sleep disorder. Accumulating evidence indicates that signs of narcolepsy may start during childhood. Recent data suggest that a deficiency in the hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin system underlies the pathogenesis of narcolepsy with cataplexy. Confirmatory tests such as polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test, and actigraphy, along with referral to a sleep physician, maybe necessary in appropriate cases. Laboratory tests such as human leukocyte antigen typing and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 analysis are useful as adjuncts. Modafinil is now considered the first-line treatment for excessive sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in patients aged more than 16 years.

Awareness of the extent of hypersomnia in children will allow physicians to effectively screen every child; once identified, further assessment should be performed in order to diagnose and treat the underlying cause. Better understanding of pathogenesis, availability of newer therapies with different mechanism of effect, and appropriately designed randomized clinical trials should allow improved management of children with narcolepsy.",2008.0

Thirty-four patients with narcolepsy/cataplexy and 35 age-matched normal controls.

Half the patients (17 subjects) had a clinical and video polysomnographic diagnosis of RBD. The average amplitude of the rectified submentalis muscle EMG signal was used to assess muscle atonia, and the new REM sleep Atonia Index was computed. Chin muscle activations were detected and their duration and interval analyzed. REM sleep Atonia Index was lower in both patient groups (with narcolepsy patients with RBD showing the lowest values) with respect to controls, and it did not correlate with age as it did in controls. The total number of chin EMG activations was significantly higher in both patient groups than controls. No significant differences were found between the two groups of patients, although more chin EMG activations were noted in narcolepsy patients with RBD than those without.

Elevated muscle activity during REM sleep is the only polysomnographic marker of RBD. This study shows that polysomnographically evident RBD is present in many patients with narcolepsy/ cataplexy. This condition might be specific to narcolepsy/cataplexy, reflecting a peculiar form of REM sleep related motor dyscontrol (i.e., status dissociatus), paving the way to enacting dream behaviors, and correlated with the specific neurochemical and neuropathological substrate of narcolepsy/cataplexy.",2008.0

Other less consistent symptoms include hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, sleep maintenance insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorders, attention deficit and weight gain at disease onset. Narcolepsy with cataplexy remains a clinical diagnosis but nighttime and daytime polysomnography (multiple sleep latency tests) are useful to document a mean sleep latency below 8 min and at least two sleep-onset REM periods. HLA typing shows an association with HLA DQB1*0602 in more than 92% of cases but was not included in the new diagnostic criteria. In contrast, a low hypocretin levels (values below 110 pg/ml) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was highly specific for narcolepsy with cataplexy. The deficiency of the hypocretin system is well-established in animal models of narcolepsy (murine and canine narcolepsy) but also in human narcoleptics with a 90% reduction of CSF hypocretin levels in relation with an early loss of hypocretin neurons. The cause of human narcolepsy remains unknown, however an autoimmune process is most probable.

When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.

The intrarater reliability for the sleep latency and sleep onset REM periods varied from the range of 0.625 to 0.991. Our study demonstrated excellent inter- and intrarater reliability in scoring the sleep latency and sleep onset REM periods of MSLT. They also had excellent agreement on the diagnosis of narcolepsy and an ""excellent to good"" agreement on the diagnosis of narcolepsy spectrum disorder and normal cases. Our study lent further support that MSLT was an objective measurement with high inter- and intrarater reliability across various sleep disorders and healthy controls among different sleep centers.",2008.0

Disorders of arousal and attention are common in closed head injury (CHI). Daytime drowsiness impairs participation in rehabilitation, whereas nighttime wakefulness leads to falls and behavioral disturbances. Sleep disturbances in TBI reported in the literature have included excessive daytime somnolence, sleep phase cycle disturbance, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea. Although well known to the clinician treating these patients, the extent and prevalence of disrupted sleep in patients in an acute inpatient rehabilitation unit has not been described.

To determine the prevalence of sleep wake cycle disturbance (SWCD) in patients with CHI in a TBI rehabilitation unit.

Prospective observational.

Inpatient specialized brain injury rehabilitation unit. Patients. Thirty-one consecutive admissions to a brain injury rehabilitation unit with the diagnosis of CHI.

Twenty-one patients (68%) had aberrations of nighttime sleep. There was no significant difference in Glasgow Coma Score on admission to trauma nor was there any significant difference in age between the affected and unaffected groups. Patients with SWCD had longer stays in both the trauma center (P < .003) and the rehabilitation center (P < .03).

There is a high prevalence of SWCD in CHI patients admitted to a brain injury rehabilitation unit. Patients with SWCD have longer stays in both acute and rehabilitation settings and may be a marker for more severe injury.",2008.0

Gray matter volumes in the bilateral hypothalamic voxel of interests (VOI) were also calculated.

Compared with the comparison subjects, narcoleptic patients had gray matter volume decrease in the right hypothalamus and other regions including subcortical, prefrontal, limbic and occipital areas. Narcoleptic patients also had lower gray matter volume on predefined VOI at the bilateral hypothalamus, which correlated with the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale score.

18446698,[Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome].,de Vicente Alvarez-Manzaneda EE,2008 May 1-15,Revista de neurologia,"Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep disorder that is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal manifestations in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep that include, among other symptoms, cataplexy (the sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions). Studies on the prevalence of narcolepsy-cataplexy in Europe and the United States have yielded a figure of 0.013-0.067% in the general population. Although its prevalence is low, it is probably under-diagnosed for a number of different reasons, the most important perhaps being the difficulties involved in its diagnosis.

Because its diagnosis is essentially clinical, complementary tests can often be very helpful. Today, it is one of the most extensively studied sleep disorders at the molecular level. Human narcolepsy is associated with diminished hypocretin/orexin concentrations, unlike the case of canine narcolepsy, where mutations in the Hcrt receptor have been found. The treatment of narcolepsy must be tailored to meet the needs of each patient after an individual analysis of his or her symptoms. Daytime sleepiness can be controlled by drugs that stimulate the central nervous system, the most common being methylphenidate and modafinil. Cataplexy is usually treated with tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The appearance of new drugs like sodium oxybate sheds a ray of light on the dark horizon of patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome.

Early identification of excessive daytime sleepiness by primary care physicians and specialists is essential for a better management and follow-up of these patients.",2008.0

This study aimed to (1) describe the clinical and polysomnographic features, and treatment outcomes, of a group of children with narcolepsy, and (2) describe other sleep disorders to be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypersomnia and which may coexist with narcolepsy. A retrospective review of 125 children referred in 1 year for hypersomnia revealed 20 patients (16%) with narcolepsy. Of these, only 15% exhibited cataplexy, 10% experienced hallucinations, and none manifested sleep paralysis. Eighty-five percent of children with narcolepsy had sleep-disordered breathing on polysomnography. Body mass indices of these children were higher than for healthy, age-matched controls subjects. Other polysomnography findings included periodic limb movements of sleep (25%) and parasomnias (5%). The multiple sleep latency test revealed a mean sleep latency of 6.14 minutes, with sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (median, 2/5 naps). Treatment with modafinil and sodium oxybate provided optimal control of daytime sleepiness. Physicians should routinely screen for hypersomnia in children by obtaining a detailed history and, in appropriate situations, ordering polysomnographic testing to rule out narcolepsy and other causes of hypersomnia.",2008.0

Twenty-five untreated patients affected with T.b.g. HAT were included. The patients were evaluated using a standardized clinical evaluation and a specific interview on sleep complaints. Diagnosis of stages I and II and intermediate stage was performed by CSF cell count and/or presence of trypanosomes: 4 patients were classified as stage II, 13 stage I, and 8 ""intermediate"" stage. Seventeen untreated patients completed continuous 24-hour polysomnography. We measured CSF levels of hypocretin-1 in all patients at different stages and evolutions, and we compared the results with 26 patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 53 neurologic controls.

CSF hypocretin-1 levels were significantly higher in T.b.g. HAT (423.2 +/- 119.7 pg/mL) than in narcoleptic patients (40.16 +/- 60.18 pg/ mL) but lower than in neurologic controls (517.32 +/- 194.5 pg/mL). One stage I patient had undetectable hypocretin levels and 1 stage II patient showed intermediate levels, both patients (out of three patients) reporting excessive daytime sleepiness but without evidence for an association with narcolepsy. No differences were found in CSF hypocretin levels between patients with HAT stages; however, the presence of major sleep-wake cycle disruptions was significantly associated with lower CSF hypocretin-1 level with a same tendency for the number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods.

The present investigation is not in favor of a unique implication of the hypocretin system in T.b.g. HAT. However, we propose that dysfunction of the hypothalamic hypocretin region may participate in sleep disturbances observed in African trypanosomiasis.",2008.0

N/A.

Relative to comparison subjects, narcoleptic patients had higher GABA concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex (t = 4.10, P <0.001). Narcoleptic patients with nocturnal sleep disturbance had higher GABA concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex than those without nocturnal sleep disturbance (t = 2.45, P = 0.03), but had lower GABA concentration than comparison subjects (t = 2.30, P = 0.03).

The current study reports that young adults with narcolepsy had a higher GABA concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex, which was more prominent in patients without nocturnal sleep disturbance. Our findings suggest that the medial prefrontal GABA level may be increased in narcolepsy, and the increased medial prefrontal GABA might be a compensatory mechanism to reduce nocturnal sleep disturbances in narcolepsy.",2008.0

Forty-three percent of patients had falls as part of their attacks. During cataplexy knees, head, and jaw were the most frequently compromised body segments; eyelids, arms, and trunk being less commonly involved. More rarely, blurred vision, slurred speech, irregular breathing, or a sudden loss of smiling mimics were reported. One-third of the sample presented with a previously unrecognized description of cataplexy that we coined ""cataplectic facies,"" consisting of a state of semipermanent eyelid and jaw weakness, on which partial or complete cataplectic attacks were superimposed.

They serve as both an update of previous practice parameters for the therapy of narcolepsy and as the first practice parameters to address treatment of other hypersomnias of central origin. They are based on evidence analyzed in the accompanying review paper. The specific disorders addressed by these parameters are narcolepsy (with cataplexy, without cataplexy, due to medical condition and unspecified), idiopathic hypersomnia (with long sleep time and without long sleep time), recurrent hypersomnia and hypersomnia due to medical condition. Successful treatment of hypersomnia of central origin requires an accurate diagnosis, individual tailoring of therapy to produce the fullest possible return of normal function, and regular follow-up to monitor response to treatment. Modafinil, sodium oxybate, amphetamine, methamphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, and selegiline are effective treatments for excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, while tricyclic antidepressants and fluoxetine are effective treatments for cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations; but the quality of published clinical evidence supporting them varies. Scheduled naps can be beneficial to combat sleepiness in narcolepsy patients. Based on available evidence, modafinil is an effective therapy for sleepiness due to idiopathic hypersomnia, Parkinson's disease, myotonic dystrophy, and multiple sclerosis. Based on evidence and/or long history of use in the therapy of narcolepsy committee consensus was that modafinil, amphetamine, methamphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methylphenidate are reasonable options for the therapy of hypersomnias of central origin.",2007.0

Up to 17 breeds of dogs are affected sporadically, and familial forms occur in dobermanns, labrador retrievers and dachshunds. These dogs display characteristics strikingly similar to those of human narcolepsy, including cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone in response to emotional stimulation) and a shorter sleep latency. It has recently been shown that the aetiology of both the familial form (receptor null mutation) and the sporadic form (loss of ligand production) of canine narcolepsy is associated with a deficit in hypocretin/orexin neurotransmission. Hypocretin deficiency can be detected by the measurement of hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid, and this could be used to diagnose hypocretin ligand deficient cases in clinical practice. Narcolepsy is neither progressive nor life-threatening, but the clinical signs persist throughout life, and lifelong treatment and care are required.

The strong association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1*0602 suggests an autoimmune basis, but supporting evidence is lacking. Although data indicate that HLA status is not the sole genetic factor, only a single case of a functional orexin system mutation has been discovered, in a study with a selection bias designed to increase yield. In this study, we examined the prepro-orexin gene for mutations in a cohort of unrelated patients with narcolepsy from a national UK referral centre.

Subjects with a diagnosis of narcolepsy were recruited from a patient database. DNA samples were obtained using buccal smear kits. The prepro-orexin gene was amplified using polymerase chain reactions and screened for polymorphisms and mutations.

Eighty-one patients were recruited, of whom 69 provided DNA samples. A previously described intronic single nucleotide polymorphism, of unlikely significance, was identified in one subject who had typical clinical and electrophysiological features of narcolepsy. It was located 16 base pairs downstream from exon 1. No other mutations were found.

The recent discovery of the hypocretins (orexins) and the subsequent confirmation that their deficiency causes narcolepsy have shed light on the pathophysiology of narcolepsy. Damage to or dysfunction of the hypothalamic cells that produce hypocretin (orexin), from whatever cause, can give rise to narcolepsy. We have conducted a review of the literature on the subject and have included only those cases that have been confirmed by polysomnography. There are approximately 20 polysomnography-confirmed cases of posttraumatic narcolepsy published in the literature, to which we add a further 2 cases. The results suggest that patients with posttraumatic narcolepsy are a heterogeneous group with respect to clinical presentation, nature and severity of injury, time from index event to symptom onset, and HLA type. There is some evidence that this type of narcolepsy may follow a progressive course, suggesting that the index event sets off a cascade sequence that may involve the hypocretin system.

Indeed, human brain activity during sleep is segregated within specific cortical and subcortical areas in relation to the sleep stage, sleep physiological events and previous waking activity. This approach has allowed sleep physiological theories developed from animal data to be confirmed, but has also introduced original concepts about the neurobiological mechanisms of sleep, dreams and memory in humans. In contrast, at present, few neuroimaging studies have been dedicated to human sleep disorders. The available work has brought interesting data that describe some aspects of the pathophysiology and neural consequences of disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea and narcolepsy. However, the interpretation of many of these results is restricted by limited sample size and spatial/temporal resolution of the employed technique. The use of neuroimaging in sleep medicine is actually restrained by concerns resulting from the technical experimental settings and the characteristics of the diseases. Nevertheless, we predict that future studies, conducted with state of the art techniques on larger numbers of patients, will be able to address these issues and contribute significantly to the understanding of the neural basis of sleep pathologies.

Narcolepsy patients spontaneously reported similar themes of post-treatment adjustment to successfully treated epilepsy patients, including symptoms of the burden of normality. Chi-squared analyses revealed that the two groups differed only on disease-specific factors, reflecting the later diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy (P<0.05).

The results support a general model of adjustment following successful treatment of chronic neurological illness, as the patient discards perceptions of illness and behaviours associated with being 'sick' and learns to become 'well'. Recognition of the burden of normality has important clinical implications for maximising the post-treatment care and outcome of narcolepsy patients.",2007.0
17277717,Recent advances in the treatment and management of excessive daytime sleepiness.,Black J; Duntley SP; Bogan RK; O'Malley MB,2007 Feb,CNS spectrums,"Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a prevalent complaint among patients in psychiatric care. Patients with conditions of EDS have often been misdiagnosed with depression due to their complaints of lack of energy, poor concentration, memory disturbance, and a reduced interest in life. Impaired alertness associated with EDS can be detrimental to a person's quality of life by causing decreased work performance, self-consciousness, low self esteem, and social isolation. Excessive sleepiness is also associated with various health problems, comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, and fatal accidents occurring after the driver has fallen asleep at the wheel. Contributing factors leading to EDS range from insufficient sleep hours to central nervous system-mediated debilitating hypersomnolence. Circadian rhythm disorders, sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy, and medications that cause sleepiness may also contribute to symptoms of EDS. Recognition of the symptoms of sleep deprivation is essential, as many such patients do not have a clear awareness of their own sleepiness. Treatment options, depending upon the condition, include light therapy or appropriate airway management techniques such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Occasionally, wakefulness-promoting medications are necessary, particularly in patients with narcolepsy. In this expert roundtable supplement, Stephen P. Duntley, MD, reviews the definition and prevalence of EDS and discusses the contributing factors and consequences of daytime sleepiness. Next, Richard K. Bogan, MD, FCCP, gives an overview of the differential diagnosis of EDS and the assessment tools available for identifying sleepiness in symptomatic patients. Finally, Mary B. O'Malley, MD, PhD, reviews treatment of EDS, including counseling on sleep hygiene and duration of sleep, mechanical treatments, bright-light therapy, and wake-promoting medications.",2007.0

Retrospective case series.

One hundred sixty-three consecutive patients with unexplained sleepiness and 282 controls recruited at St. Vincent's Hospital, Korea. The gold standard for diagnosis was ICSD-2 criteria. Patients and controls completed the Stanford Sleep Inventory, and agreed to HLA typing. Polysomnography (87%), Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) (96%), and CSF hypocretin-1 measurements (53%) were conducted in patients.

Most patients (80%) could be classified using the ICSD-2. The 33 patients who could not be classified were without cataplexy (4 with low CSF hypocretin-1). These could not be included because of sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index > or = 5/h, 84%) and/or because sleep prior to MSLT was less than 6 hours (27%). Narcolepsy with cataplexy cases were 92% HLA positive with low hypocretin-1. Cataplexy at interview was predicted by validated Stanford Sleep Inventory questions regarding cataplexy triggers. In contrast, cataplexy-like events were frequently reported in all groups, including controls. Cases with narcolepsy without cataplexy were frequently men (73%) and heterogeneous biologically (36% HLA positive, 40% with low CSF hypocretin-1). None of the controls had low CSF hypocretin-1, whereas 13% were HLA positive.

The ICSD-2 was easily applicable in cases with typical cataplexy. In these cases, the MSLT and further evaluations were almost always positive and may thus not always be needed. Many patients without cataplexy were difficult to classify because of difficulties in interpreting the MSLT in the presence of sleep apnea or reduced sleep.",2006.0

Neurological involvement has been recognised in 40% of patients, either as initial manifestations or during the course of the disease. We report on a 45 years-old man with WD with initial, persistent and irresistible episodes of daytime somnolence. The patient was HLA-DQB1*0602 positive (genetic marker for narcolepsy). WD diagnosis was suspected on clinical and MRI basis and confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical study of duodenal biopsy. Forty months later all clinical features improved, narcoleptic-like episodes disappeared and cerebral MRI and CSF normalised. Longitudinal neurophysiological studies revealed persistent sleep pattern abnormalities with sleep fragmentation, paucity of slow wave and of REM sleep. The disruption of the hypocretin circuitry in the hypothalamic - diencephalic region triggered by the infection was the probable cause of the hypersomnia and narcopleptic symptoms. WD should be added to the list of causes of secondary hypersomnia.",2006.0
17015503,The psychosocial problems of children with narcolepsy and those with excessive daytime sleepiness of uncertain origin.,Stores G; Montgomery P; Wiggs L,2006 Oct,Pediatrics,"Narcolepsy is a predominantly rapid eye movement sleep disorder with onset usually in the second decade but often in earlier childhood. Classically it is characterized by combinations of excessive sleepiness especially sleep attacks, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The psychosocial effects of this lifelong condition are not well documented, especially in children. This study aims to describe the psychosocial profile of a large group of children with narcolepsy compared with other excessively sleepy children and controls.

We used an international cross-sectional questionnaire survey of children aged from 4 to 18 years who had received from a physician a diagnosis of narcolepsy compared with age- and gender-matched controls. Assessments were made of behavior, mood, quality of life, and educational aspects.

Recruited children were separated into those who met conventional criteria for narcolepsy (n = 42) and those whose primary complaint was excessive daytime sleepiness without definite additional features of narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness group; n = 18). Compared with controls, children with narcolepsy and also those with excessive daytime sleepiness alone showed significantly higher rates of behavioral problems and depression. Again, to a significant extent, their quality of life was poorer and they had more educational problems. The children with narcolepsy and the excessive daytime sleepiness group were indistinguishable from each other on these measures.

A range of psychosocial problems can be identified in children with narcolepsy. The origins of these problems are unclear. The similar profiles of difficulties in the narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness groups suggest that excessive sleepiness is the main cause. Clinicians and others responsible for the care of such children need to be mindful of the importance of early detection, intervention, and, ideally, the prevention of these problems.",2006.0

All patients diagnosed to have narcolepsy in the Sleep Disorders Center at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between March 1998 and December 2005 based on the International Classifications of Sleep Disorders Diagnostic and Coding Manual criteria were included. A data entry form collecting the demographic, clinical features, medications, referring specialty, prior diagnoses and daytime sleepiness was used. All patients underwent polysomnography followed by multiple sleep latency.

Forty-seven patients with a mean age of 28.9 +/- 1.9 years were included. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 20.5 +/- 1.4 years. The interval between symptoms onset and diagnosis was 8.4 +/- 1.2 years. While 22 (46.8%) of the patients were referred to the sleep disorders clinic by different specialties, 25 (53.2%) patients sought an appointment in the sleep disorders clinic directly. Only 3 patients were referred with the correct diagnosis. Nocturnal sleep quality was worse in narcoleptics with cataplexy compared to those without cataplexy.

Saudi patients with narcolepsy have the same clinical presentation as reported in the Western literature. Narcoleptics with cataplexy had disturbed quality compared to narcoleptics without cataplexy.

Seventy-seven patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy were included in the final analysis. Health-related quality of life was assessed by SF-36 questionnaire.

Men and women with narcolepsy had lower scores in all SF-36 domains, except vitality. Most profoundly affected were bodily pain (men: p = 0.0001, women: p = 0.0001), social function (men: p = 0.0001, women: p = 0.0001) and general health (men p = 0.04, women: p = 0.0001).

Narcolepsy has a clear negative effect on quality of life which is not sufficiently counteracted by medical treatment. We suggest that earlier diagnosis and treatment after onset of symptoms may be important in reducing the negative effects on quality of life.

However, previous studies have shown the prevalence of SOREMPS in healthy volunteers and apneic patients to be higher than expected.

Cross-sectional laboratory-based analysis.

Sleep disorders clinic.

Population-based sample.

N/A.

A population-based sample of 333 subjects was assessed by nocturnal polysomnography and daytime MSLT (5 naps), and an additional 206 subjectively sleepy people were also assessed (total = 539). Sample demographics were comparable to the 2000 census. Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were also determined. Groups were formed based on a median split of each sleep variable (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, MSLT, total sleep time from nocturnal polysomnography) for comparisons of SOREMPs in each group.

The prevalence of 2 or more SOREMPs was 3.9%. Only mean sleep latency on the MSLT was a discriminator for the presence of 2 or more SOREMPs (short latency = 6.3%, long latency = 1.9%, p < .05). Among the subjects who had an MSLT of 5 minutes or less (an indicator of a pathologic level of sleepiness), 9.5% had 2 or more SOREMPS.

The overall prevalence of 2 or more SOREMPs in our sample is 3.9%. Interestingly, of the variables assessed (MSLT, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and total sleep time from nocturnal polysomnography), objective sleepiness, as determined by the MSLT, was the only measure significantly associated with 2 or more SOREMPs. Therefore, subpopulations with excessive sleepiness (eg, shift workers, young adults, patients with apnea) are likely to have a greater prevalence of SOREMPs.",2006.0

Despite a number of investigations and review by two sleep specialists, a formal diagnosis could not be made. During his medical review board three questions were posed: does the trainee have excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), or is his sleepiness a variation of normal; if he is excessively sleepy, what is the most likely diagnosis; and should the trainee be allowed to continue to undertake pilot training based on most likely diagnosis and/or his history. The most likely diagnosis was considered to be idiopathic hypersomnia, a relatively uncommon condition which is a diagnosis of exclusion. The condition was considered incompatible with flight duties in a pilot under training due to the potential for compromise of performance, mission completion, and flight safety. Stimulant medications may control symptoms, but are incompatible with flying duties in the Australian Defense Force. This case illustrates the difficulties in determining aeromedical disposition in borderline cases of EDS where a clear diagnosis cannot be made.",2006.0

16633807,Sleepiness is not the inverse of alertness: evidence from four sleep disorder patient groups.,Moller HJ; Devins GM; Shen J; Shapiro CM,2006 Aug,Experimental brain research,"The constructs ""sleepiness"" and ""alertness"" are often assumed to be reciprocal states of consciousness. This distinction is of increasing concern in relation to psychomotor performance tasks such as driving. We developed two separate subjective scales of alertness to complement existing sleepiness scales. Subjective sleepiness and alertness were compared in four groups of sleep-disordered patients. In a 175-patient cohort [25 narcoleptics and 50 each with sleep apnea, insomnia and periodic leg movement disorder (PLMD)], the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was used to measure sleepiness while the Toronto Hospital Alertness Test (THAT) and ZOGIM Alertness Scale (ZOGIM-A) were used to measure alertness. Significant differences existed for sleepiness scores, with narcoleptics scoring highest on the ESS, followed by sleep apnea, with similar ESS scores for insomnia and PLMD. By contrast, alertness scores on both the THAT and ZOGIM-A did not differ significantly between the four groups. Sleepiness scores show a correlation of close to nil to alertness scores for the combined sleep disorder patient cohort, with the exception of insomnia patients, where a modest but significant inverse relationship was noted between sleepiness and alertness. Subjective states of impaired alertness and excessive sleepiness are independent constructs in the evaluation of sleep-disordered patients. The specific primary sleep disorder diagnosis may play a relevant role in mitigating this interrelationship.",2006.0

We report on the prevalence and correlates of SOREMPs in the community-based Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study. MSLTs were conducted following nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and daily sleep diaries in 289 males and 267 females (age 35-70, 97% Caucasians). Multiple SOREMPs were observed in 13.1% of males and 5.6% of females. An MSLT mean sleep latency < or =8 min and > or =2 SOREMPs (diagnostic of narcolepsy) was observed in 5.9% (males) and 1.1% (females), all without cataplexy. Because of significant sex interactions, analyses were stratified by sex. Increased prevalence of HLA-DQB1*0602, a marker of narcolepsy, was observed in males but not in females with > or =2 SOREMPs. Males with multiple SOREMPs compared with those with no SOREMPs had shorter rapid eye movement (REM) latency during NPSG, were sleepier on the MSLT and reported increased sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy-like symptoms, suggesting a narcolepsy-like phenotype. In males only, the occurrence of SOREMPs increased with shift work and some indirect markers of sleep restriction, such as shorter sleep a day before NPSG. SOREMPs were unrelated to age, body mass index, depression (Zung Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Scale) and the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep (AHI), but were associated with decreased mean lowest oxygen saturation in males. Finally, we found that both males and females with SOREMPs reported taking more antidepressants, but those were of the types known not to suppress REM sleep. These results suggest a high prevalence of narcolepsy without cataplexy, as defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, and/or a large number of false-positives for the MSLT.",2006.0

15994123,Reevaluating spells initially identified as cataplexy.,Krahn LE,2005 Nov,Sleep medicine,"Cataplexy, transient episodes of bilateral muscle weakness with areflexia provoked by emotions, is a state highly specific to narcolepsy. Cataplexy is diagnosed based on clinical interview. Two screening tools have been developed recently but their usefulness has been limited because of length or current lack of psychometric data. Used effectively even these screening tests require the interpreting physician to have an understanding of the typical features of cataplexy. Most physicians encounter patients with cataplexy fairly infrequently, making it difficult to gain proficiency in detecting cataplexy based on clinical interview alone. Relatively little attention has been given to the differential diagnosis of cataplexy, which increases the likelihood of unnecessary sleep testing or false positive diagnosis.

This case series describes six cases where cataplexy was initially diagnosed. In all cases the weakness spells were eventually not attributed to cataplexy. The presentation and characteristics of these cases will be presented as a means to discuss the differential diagnosis of cataplexy.

These cases represent a diverse set of medical disorders including bradycardia, migraine, delayed sleep phase syndrome, conversion disorder, malingering and a chronic psychotic disorder.

A more in-depth understanding of the classic features of cataplexy should improve recognition of this fascinating state. Improved cataplexy recognition will enhance the appropriate usage of sleep tests and eventually increase the timeliness and accuracy of the diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy.",2005.0

15935192,Narcolepsy and disorders of excessive somnolence.,Dyken ME; Yamada T,2005 Jun,Primary care,"Recent studies provide valid criteria that help differentiate idiopathic narcolepsy from other disorders of excessive daytime somnolence [3]. Research to date suggests that idiopathic narcolepsy might properly be considered a disorder of excessive sleepiness with dysfunctional REM-sleep mechanisms, clinically evidenced as cataplexy and electrophysiologically recognized as SOREMPs. Given these criteria, a diagnosis can generally be made using a combination of history, PSG, and MSLT. Traditionally, the medical treatment of idiopathic narcolepsy has centered on a two-drug regimen (stimulants for sleepiness and TCAs for cataplexy and auxiliary symptoms). Some newer medications are proving efficacious for sleepiness with minimal adverse effects, whereas others may provide a single-drug regimen that simultaneously addresses sleepiness and cataplexy [18]. New research has allowed some experts to hypothesize that idiopathic narcolepsy may be the result of a genetic predisposition to autoimmune disease [176]. It is possible that aberrant genetic coding of elements in the hypocretin/orexin systems allows a sensitivity to inducible and possibly virally mediated changes, which leave cells in the lateral hypothalamus susceptible to autoimmune attack [96]. As such, genetic screening of high-risk individuals might eventually rationalize the prophylactic use of immunosuppressants in some instances. In the future, for atypical cases(poorly responsive to therapy), genetic, CSF, and brain imaging studies, and possibly even neuronal transplantation may prove beneficial in the assessment and treatment of idiopathic narcolepsy.",2005.0

Many paroxysmal events mimic epileptic seizures and misdiagnosis can have disastrous consequences. Incorrectly identifying an event as an epileptic seizure can lead to unnecessary investigations and instigation of inappropriate treatment regimes. We report five patients referred to regional Paediatric Neuroscience Centres for investigation of events initially suspected of being epileptic seizures. All five patients were subsequently diagnosed as having narcolepsy. Suspected diagnoses were absence epilepsy (four patients), generalized epilepsy with astatic seizures (two patients) and focal epileptic seizures (two patients). Diagnostic confusion arose because lack of responsiveness due to excessive sleepiness was mistaken for epileptic absences, and cataplexy was confused with a variety of seizure types. In each case, videotape recording of clinical events aided in making the diagnosis of cataplexy. At presentation, all five children had excessive daytime sleepiness with cataplexy. Following correct diagnosis and appropriate management, an improvement in symptoms was reported in all cases. Narcolepsy/cataplexy should be included in the differential diagnoses of paroxysmal disorders, particularly if there are associated sleep symptoms or behavioural difficulties.

These practice parameters were developed to guide the sleep clinician on appropriate clinical use of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). These recommendations replace those published in 1992 in a position paper produced by the American Sleep Disorders Association. A Task Force of content experts was appointed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to perform a comprehensive review of the scientific literature and grade the evidence regarding the clinical use of the MSLT and the MWT. Practice parameters were developed based on this review and in most cases evidence based methods were used to support recommendations. When data were insufficient or inconclusive, the collective opinion of experts was used to support recommendations. These recommendations were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The MSLT is indicated as part of the evaluation of patients with suspected narcolepsy and may be useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected idiopathic hypersomnia. The MSLT is not routinely indicated in the initial evaluation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, or in assessment of change following treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The MSLT is not routinely indicated for evaluation of sleepiness in medical and neurological disorders (other than narcolepsy), insomnia, or circadian rhythm disorders. The MWT may be indicated in assessment of individuals in whom the inability to remain awake constitutes a safety issue, or in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia to assess response to treatment with medications. There is little evidence linking mean sleep latency on the MWT with risk of accidents in real world circumstances. For this reason, the sleep clinician should not rely solely on mean sleep latency as a single indicator of impairment or risk for accidents, but should also rely on clinical judgment. Assessment should involve integration of findings from the clinical history, compliance with treatment, and, in some cases, objective testing using the MWT. These practice parameters also include recommendations for the MSLT and MWT protocols, a discussion of the normative data available for both tests, and a description of issues that need further study.",2005.0
15685112,"[Narcolepsy, from Westphal to hypocretin].",Dauvilliers Y; Carlander B; Billiard M,2004 Dec 18,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)","Narcolepsy is a poorly known disease, though not exceptional, with a prevalence of 25 to 35 per 100,000 according to various surveys. Its onset can be anytime from childhood to the fifties with a peak in the second decade. It is characterized by two cardinal symptoms, irresistible sleep episodes and cataplexy or sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotional situations. The other symptoms, referred to as accessory due to their inconstancy, are hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and disturbed nocturnal sleep. Its diagnosis relies on the identification of the cardinal symptoms. Laboratory tests are required to confirm the diagnosis before initiation of a life-long treatment. Theses test include: all-night and daytime polysomnography documenting sleep-onset REM periods, HLA typing, showing the association with HLA DQB1*0602, and, in unclear cases only, measurement of cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) hypocretine-1 showing values below 110pg/ml, highly specific of narcolepsy with cataplexy. Pathophysiology owes a lot to the existence of a natural canine model, the narcoleptic dog. Irresistible sleep episodes and cataplexy exhibit different pharmacological control, the former depending on dopaminergic systems and the latter on noradrenergic systems. The most remarkable findings of the last twenty years are the close association with HLA DQB1*0602, the identification of a mutation of hypocretin receptor 2 in the narcoleptic dog and the absence of CSF hypocretin-1 in 90% of patients. An autoimmune mechanism is suggested but not evidenced. THREE-FOLD TREATMENT: First line treatment of irresistible sleep episodes in modafinil, Cataplexy or tricyclic antidepressants or sodium oxybate, and disturbed nocturnal sleep by hypnotics or sodium oxybate. Current therapeutic research is oriented towards hypocretin agonists and immunosuppressors.",2004.0

Individuals with CFS complain of fatigue and poor sleep--symptoms that are often attributed to psychological disturbance. To assess the nature and prevalence of sleep disturbance in CFS and to investigate the widely presumed presence of psychological maladjustment we examined sleep quality, sleep disorders, physical health, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and psychological adjustment in three samples. individuals with CFS; a healthy control group; and individuals with a definite medical diagnosis: narcolepsy. Outcome measures included physiological evaluation (polysomnography), medical diagnosis, structured interview, and self-report measures. Results indicate that the CFS sample had a very high incidence (58%) of previously undiagnosed primary sleep disorder such as sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome and restless legs/periodic limb movement disorder. They also had very high rates of self-reported insomnia and nonrestorative sleep. Narcolepsy and CFS participants were very similar on psychological adjustment: both these groups had more psychological maladjustment than did control group participants. Our data suggest that primary sleep disorders in individuals with CFS are underdiagnosed in primary care settings and that the psychological disturbances seen in CFS may well be the result of living with a chronic illness that is poorly recognized or understood.",2004.0

We treated four hypocretin/orexin-deficient narcolepsy patients with intravenous immunoglobulins and assessed the efficacy by repeated polysomnographies and questionnaires. Three patients received the treatment within a few months after acute onset of narcolepsy. A clear improvement in the frequency and severity of cataplexy was obtained with a benefic effect up to 7 months without any anticataplectics drugs at follow-up.

15560774,The clinical spectrum of narcolepsy with cataplexy: a reappraisal.,Sturzenegger C; Bassetti CL,2004 Dec,Journal of sleep research,"In the absence of a golden standard for the diagnosis of narcolepsy, the clinical spectrum of disorder remains controversial. The aims of this study were (1) to determine frequency and characteristics of sleep-wake symptoms in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, (2) to compare clinical characteristics with results of ancillary tests, and (3) to identify factors that discriminate narcolepsy from other conditions with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). We prospectively studied 57 narcoleptics with cataplexy, 56 patients with non-narcoleptic hypersomnia (H), and 40 normal controls (No). Based on suggested and published criteria, we differentiated between narcoleptics with definite cataplexy (N) and narcoleptics without definite cataplexy (possible cataplexy, NpC). Assessment consisted of questionnaires [all patients and controls, including the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Score (UNS)], polysomnography (all patients), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and human leukocyte antigen typing (in most narcoleptics). A new narcolepsy score based on five questions was developed. Data were compared with those of 12 hypocretin-deficient narcoleptics (N-hd). There were significant differences between N and NpC (including mean sleep latency on MSLT), but none between N and N-hd. A score of sleep propensity during active situations (SPAS) and the frequency of sleep paralysis/hallucinations at sleep onset, dreams of flying, and history of sleep shouting discriminated N from H and No (P < 0.001). Cataplexy-like symptoms in H (18%) and No (8%) could be discriminated from 'true' cataplexy in N on the basis of topography of motor effects, triggering emotions and triggering situations (P < 0.001). Our narcolepsy score had a similar sensitivity (96% versus 98%) but a higher specificity (98% versus 56%) than the UNS. Analysis of co-occurring symptoms in narcolepsy revealed two symptom complexes: EDS, cataplexy, automatic behaviors; and sleep paralysis, hallucinations, parasomnias. Low/undetectable cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and a history of definite cataplexy identify similar subgroups of narcoleptics. Specific questions on severity of EDS (SPAS score) and characteristics of cataplexy allow the recognition of subgroups of narcoleptics and their differentiation from non-narcoleptic EDS patients, including those reporting cataplexy-like episodes. The existence of co-occurring symptoms supports the hypothesis of a distinct pathophysiology of single narcoleptic symptoms.",2004.0
15548552,Combination of 'idiopathic' REM sleep behaviour disorder and olfactory dysfunction as possible indicator for alpha-synucleinopathy demonstrated by dopamine transporter FP-CIT-SPECT.,Stiasny-Kolster K; Doerr Y; Möller JC; Höffken H; Behr TM; Oertel WH; Mayer G,2005 Jan,Brain : a journal of neurology,"REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and olfactory dysfunction are common and very early features of alpha-synucleinopathies, in particular Parkinson's disease. To investigate the hypothesis that these two clinical features in combination are an indicator of evolving alpha-synucleinopathy, olfactory function was assessed in RBD. We studied 30 patients (18 male, 12 female; mean age 48 +/- 14 years, range 19-78 years) with clinical (idiopathic, n = 6; symptomatic, n = 13, mostly associated with narcolepsy) or subclinical (n = 11, associated with narcolepsy) RBD according to standard criteria and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects using standardized 'Sniffin' Sticks'. RBD patients had a significantly higher olfactory threshold (P = 0.0001), lower discrimination score (P = 0.003), and lower identification score (P = 0.001). Compared with normative data, 97% of the RBD patients had a pathologically increased olfactory threshold, 63% an impaired odour discrimination score, and 63% a decreased identification score. On neurological examination, signs of parkinsonism were newly found in five patients with clinical RBD (not associated with narcolepsy), who usually had a long history of 'idiopathic' RBD. Four of the five patients fulfilled the UK Brain Bank criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The underlying nigrostriatal degeneration of clinical Parkinson's disease was confirmed by I-123-FP-CIT SPECT in one patient and early nigrostriatal degeneration was identified by SPECT in a further two patients with 'idiopathic' clinical RBD out of 11 RBD patients who agreed to undergo SPECT studies. Our study shows that RBD patients have a profound impairment of olfactory function. Five patients with clinical RBD not associated with narcolepsy had clinical or imaging signs of nigrostriatal degeneration. This new clinical finding correlates with the neuropathological staging of Parkinson's disease (stages 1-3) as proposed by Braak. In stage 1, the anterior olfactory nucleus or the olfactory bulb is affected (along with the dorsal motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves). In stage 2, additional lesions consistently remain confined to the medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum, which are critical areas for RBD. Midbrain lesions are found only in stage 3, in particular degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Thus, 'idiopathic' RBD patients with olfactory impairment might present with stage 2 preclinical alpha-synucleinopathy. Since narcoleptic patients are not known to have an increased risk of developing parkinsonism, the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of hyposmia in RBD/narcolepsy patients requires further research.",2005.0

The present study aimed to investigate the diagnostic basis of childhood narcolepsy and possible role of HLA Class II alleles in the onset of this disease.

The clinical data of 40 narcoleptic children were analyzed. All patients received Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and they were analyzed in combination with clinical features. Polymerase chain reaction/sequence specific primers (PCR/SSP) methods were used to detect the HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles.

Narcolepsy was diagnosed in 40 children. The age range was 3 to 14 years (mean 8.5 +/- 2.5 years), 29 were male and 11 female. Their mean course of disease was 6.5 months, 14 patients (30%) were less than 3 months old, 21 patients (52%) were less than 6 months old. All the patients had excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy appeared in 37 cases, hypnagogic hallucination in 22 and sleep paralysis in 6. Mean sleep latency on MSLT was less than 5 min, the average number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) was 4.33 +/- 0.26 episodes (2-5 episodes), the latency of SOREM episodes were 4.0 +/- 1.8 min (0.25-4.9 min). Thirty-five patients were DRB1 1501 and DQB1 0602 positive (Pc < 0.01), 2 were DRB1 1502 and DQB1 0601 positive, while 3 were DRB1 15 and DQB1 6 negative.

Some pediatric patients with narcolepsy were different from adult patients in that the pediatric cases had a sudden onset and shorter disease course. Diagnosis of this disease was based on the clinical manifestations, MSLT and absence of any medical or psychiatric disorder that could account for the symptoms. The authors demonstrated that DRB1 1501 and DQB1 0602 were susceptibility genes for narcolepsy and those who were DRB1 15 negative could not be excluded.",2004.0

A retrospective, case-control design was used to compare the body mass index (BMI) of 31 narcolepsy children at the time of diagnosis with that of healthy, age- and gender-matched controls.

The median BMI in the narcolepsy subjects was 22.93 as compared to that in controls of 20.36 (P=0.001). BMI did not differ significantly between narcolepsy subjects who had received prior psychotropic medications and those who had not. The mean BMI of 22 of 31 narcolepsy subjects who had not received psychotropic medications prior to diagnosis was also significantly higher than that of controls (25.1, SEM 1.53 versus 21.1, SEM 0.56; P=0.008 ).

The tendency for increased weight gain is intrinsic to childhood narcolepsy and is manifested relatively early in the course of the disorder. Correlation of this finding with hypocretin and leptin metabolism may further understanding of the pathogenesis of narcolepsy.",2004.0

The management of the patients is very important. The present study focused on the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods and long-term prognosis of this particular syndrome.

The clinical data of 39 narcoleptic children were analyzed. Sleep EEG monitoring was performed in all patients. Among the 39 cases, 23 were followed up.

All the patients manifested with excessive daytime sleepiness, with disrupted nocturnal sleep occurring in 35 cases. Cataplexy appeared in 36 cases, and sleep paralysis in 9, hypnagogic hallucination in 19, and automatic behavior in 6 cases, respectively. Sleep EEG monitoring demonstrated a short mean sleep latency (< 5 minutes) and two or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in 38 cases. Twenty-three of the 39 cases were followed-up. Seventeen cases were followed-up for over one year. The longest follow-up duration was 14 years. Methylphenidate was administered in 10 cases. The excessive daytime sleepiness had been improved in 7 cases (70%). No obvious adverse effects were found. Psychosocial and academic problems appeared in most cases.

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder. A definite diagnosis is established when the symptoms of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness occur in association with the characteristic findings on sleep EEG monitoring. Appropriate drug therapy and psychosocial management are of help for such patients. Stimulant medication is an important component of the overall treatment program. A comprehensive approach is necessary to meet the needs of children with narcolepsy. Family education and emotional support are key elements in the management plan. The overall goal for managing childhood narcolepsy is to assist the child and family in achieving optimal quality of life.",2003.0

In this case study presentation the patient suffered a head trauma, without unconsciousness, and began to experience unusual episodic behaviours. Symptom presentation differed from the typical clinical manifestations of idiopathic narcolepsy leading to an 8-year search for a definitive diagnosis. Key relevant aspects that led to diagnostic ambiguities were the order of symptom development, negative for the antigen HLA DR2, significance of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) mean sleep latency versus number of sleep onset rapid eye movement periods, the somewhat atypical features of cataplexy, the coexistence of sleep apnoea, and the mildness of the original head injury. It is argued that cases of post-traumatic narcolepsy should be considered in the context of their clinical development over time and that practitioners should be aware that this form of narcolepsy can differ from the typical clinical history of idiopathic narcolepsy.",2004.0

There are no multivariate analyses reported in the literature of factors that may contribute to this delay. The aims of this study were to describe the delay in diagnosis of people with narcolepsy living in the UK and to identify associated factors.

The study comprised a postal survey of 500 members of the Narcolepsy Association UK, which included questions regarding age of onset of symptoms, year of diagnosis and subject demographics. Cox's proportional hazards regression was performed.

A total of 313 questionnaires were returned of which 219 had been completed sufficiently for analysis. The interval between symptom onset and diagnosis ranged from within 1 to 61 years with a median of 10.5 years. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of cataplexy as one of the initial symptoms and a more recent year of symptom onset were the only factors associated with time to diagnosis.

We have confirmed that the diagnosis of narcolepsy can be delayed for many years particularly when cataplexy is absent initially. The delay in diagnosis in the UK appears to be decreasing, probably through greater doctor and patient awareness of the clinical manifestations of narcolepsy.",2004.0

Clinical and polygraphic information on the severity of the condition was obtained on 236 well-defined narcolepsy-cataplexy-human leukocyte antigen DR2-positive patients from Montpellier (France) and on 147 similar patients from Montreal (Canada).

The results show a progressive decrease in the number of SOREMP with age and a progressive increase in the mean sleep latency on the MSLT as a function of age. This finding is also related to the severity of cataplexy as assessed from the clinical history with a progressive decrease in the frequency of cataplexy attacks with age. These results may reflect the progressive increase in sleep latency seen in normal aging and suggest that clinical improvement might be due to changes in the neural mechanisms responsible for SOREMP, which may weaken with age.

The progressive decrease in the number of SOREMP and increase in the mean sleep latency on the MSLT as a function of age suggest that the current criteria used for diagnosis may be too stringent in older patients. The major influence of age on MSLT results should therefore be taken into account when diagnosing a narcoleptic patient.",2004.0

The main focus of this article is on movement disorders, neuromuscular diseases, multiple sclerosis, dementia, cerebrovascular diseases, head and brain trauma, pain and epilepsy. General management strategies for EDS in all these neurological diseases include sleep hygiene aspects such as extensions of noctural time in bed and frequent naps during the day.

Sleep studies; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging studies with a focus on the hypothalamus; examinations of cerebrospinal fluid for cytology, protein, and hypocretin-1 levels; and HLA typing were performed.

A 3-week regimen of 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) of prednisone was administered in an attempt to modify the course of the disease.

Sleep evaluations were consistent with a diagnosis of narcolepsy. Hypocretin-1 was absent in the cerebrospinal fluid, and HLA-DQB1*0602 was present.

The clinical borderland of narcolepsy and the diagnostic value of different markers of narcolepsy remain controversial and were assessed in a consecutive series of 27 patients with hypersomnia of (mainly) neurological origin.

Diagnoses included classical narcolepsy (n=3), symptomatic narcolepsy (n=1), narcolepsy without cataplexy (n=4), idiopathic hypersomnia (n=5), hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders (n=5), and hypersomnia secondary to neurological disorders or of undetermined origin (n=9). Clinical assessment included BMI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS), and history of REM-symptoms (sleep paralysis, hallucinations). HLA-typing, electrophysiological studies (conventional polysomnography, MSLT, 1-week actigraphy), and measurements of CSF levels of hypocretin and leptin were also performed.

Hypocretin-1 was undetectable in three patients with classic narcolepsy and detectable in the remaining 24 patients. Other narcoleptic markers also frequently found in patients without narcolepsy included ESS>14 (78% of 27 patients), UNS>14 (75%), REM symptoms (30%), sleep latencies on MSLT<5 min (41%), >/=2 SOREM (30%), DQB1*0602 positivity (52%), BMI>25 (52%), and increased CSF leptin (48%).

14580598,Clinical aspects and pathophysiology of narcolepsy.,Dauvilliers Y; Billiard M; Montplaisir J,2003 Nov,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,"Narcolepsy is a chronic debilitating sleep disorder first described in the late 19th century. It is characterized by two major symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, and two so-called auxiliary symptoms, hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. The final diagnosis relies on polysomnography showing the presence of sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) during the multiple sleep latency test. The presence of HLA DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 is supportive of the diagnosis. The pathophysiology of the disorder is still unknown but an imbalance between monoamines and acetylcholine is generally accepted. Recent findings in narcoleptic dogs, a natural model of narcolepsy, and in knockout mice revealed that a mutation of type 2 hypocretin receptor plays a major role in the etiology of narcolepsy. Up to now, no mutation has been found in humans except a case of early onset and atypical narcolepsy. However, a marked reduction of hypocretin type 1 has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a majority of patients and a global loss of hypocretins was noted in post-mortem brain tissue of narcoleptic subjects. Conversely, no hypocretin neuron degeneration has been observed in the genetic form of narcolepsy in dogs but no trace of hypocretin was seen in the brain or the CSF in cases of sporadic canine narcolepsy. This suggests that different hypocretinergic mechanisms are involved in sporadic and genetic forms of canine narcolepsy. Treatment has not evolved significantly over the last few years. However, new drugs, such as hypocretin agonists, are currently being developed.

After the discovery of the type 2 hypocretin receptor mutation in canine narcolepsy and the finding of a CSF hypocretin-1 deficiency in human narcolepsy, the major stream of research has involved the hypocretinergic system. However, other lines of research deserve to be pursued simultaneously, in view of comprehensive advancements in the understanding of narcolepsy.",2003.0

The subgroup defined by a history of cataplexy was the most homogeneous in clinical and polygraphic variables. However, only 83% of these subjects had two or more SOREMPs in one MSLT. The subgroup defined by two or more SOREMPs included many patients without cataplexy. A disproportionate number of these subjects were older women whose chances of developing cataplexy are remote. This group of older women had a higher number of periodic leg movements during sleep than the other groups. Patients with both cataplexy and two or more SOREMPs have the greatest chance of being DR2 DQw1 positive. Thus, the combination of history of cataplexy and two or more SOREMPs is the best clinical determinant of narcolepsy. However, two or more SOREMPs is a poorer discriminant of narcolepsy than history of cataplexy.",1993.0

The intention of the present study was to investigate the structure of MSLT naps and in particular sleep spindle and k-complex density in three different groups of EDS patients. MSLT was performed at 8 a.m., 10 a.m. 12 a.m., 2. p.m. and 4 p.m.. Each recording lasted 20 minutes and was not stopped even if sleep occurred before 20 min. Sleep was scored visually. Spindle and k-complex density was determined per minute of S2 sleep. Statistical analysis used ANOVA. Each of the three groups consisted of 15 patients. Diagnosis of narcolepsy, sleep apnea, of EDS due to a psychiatric disorder has been confirmed subsequently. There were 5 female and 10 male narcoleptics (mean age: 43.9 +/- 10.9 years), 2 female and 13 male obstructive sleep apnea patients (mean age: 53.9 +/- 10.9 years) and 7 female and 8 male patients complaining of EDS, in whom a psychiatric disorder was diagnosed (mean age: 38.8 +/- 13.8 years). Narcoleptics sent more than half of the recording time of 100 min asleep (52.9%). Apnea patients slept 41.3% and psychogenic EDS patients 22.7%. The proportion of sleep stages 1 and 2 in narcoleptics (S2/S1 = 1:1) was clearly different from the other two (apnea patients: S2/S1 = 4:1; psychogenic EDS patients: S2/S1 = 3:1). 18.5% of the naps contained stage REM and during the afternoon naps 0.9% of S3 in the narcoleptics. Neither REM nor S3 was observed in the others.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992.0

We performed HLA typing in 18 Australian narcoleptics using serological techniques and sequence specific oligonucleotide probes. HLA-DQw1 was present in 15 patients and DR2 in 12; 3 patients with cataplectic narcolepsy were DR2-negative. The serological haplotype most strongly associated with narcolepsy was DRw15 (a subtype of DR2), DQw1. DRw15-positive patients were positive for the alleles DRB1*1501 and DQB1*0602 defined with oligonucleotide probes. We conclude that the association of narcolepsy with DR2 and DQw1 is not as strong as previously reported and the absence of DR2 or DQw1 does not preclude the diagnosis of classical narcolepsy, at least in caucasians. Secondly, DR2-positive narcoleptics possess characteristic serological subtypes and alleles defined with oligonucleotide probes that are also found in normals. Thirdly, the occurrence of DR2-negative cataplectic narcoleptics points to the existence of more than one narcolepsy susceptibility gene.",1992.0

In black narcoleptic patients, susceptibility for narcolepsy is more closely related to a specific gene subtype of DQw1, DQB1-0602, than to DR2. About 30% of black narcoleptic patients are nonDR2, but all carry the HLA DQB1-0602 gene. In the present study, we have tested caucasian nonDR2 cataplectic patients (6 sporadic cases and 7 familial cases from 3 multiplex families) for the presence of the HLA DQB1-0602 and DQA1-0102 (DQw1) using a specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-oligotyping technique. None of the patients was DQB1-0602 or DQA1-0102 positive, thus proving that, in caucasians, DQB1-0602 and DQA1-0102 (DQw1) are not prerequisites for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. Further studies with more patients are warranted to exclude the possibility that a few caucasian patients carry rare haplotypes with DQB1-0602 independently of DR2.",1992.0

The recently detected high correlation between a certain HLA status and cataplexy has led to new pathogenetic concepts. The primary aim of the therapy is to keep the patient at work rather than attempting a symptom free state. Measures to organize his day with planned naps should precede the use of medication. Besides stimulants against daytime somnolence and tricyclic antidepressants to suppress cataplectic attacks, some new drugs have been administered successfully against the various symptoms of narcolepsy in recent years.",1992.0

The condition is multi-factorial, dependent on lifestyle, mood and personality, as well as on familial factors but no single factor in isolation is sufficient to explain the delay in sleep timing. Refusal to attend school may be important in some instances but will not explain cases with delayed age of onset. In half the subjects the delay in sleep phase started in childhood or adolescence. The syndrome causes severe disruption to education, work and family life. Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (""time-markers"", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment. Treatment by forced sleep-wake phase advance or with melatonin resulted in a partial sleep-phase advance but this was not maintained on stopping treatment.",1992.0

Nevertheless narcolepsy in which the hallucinatory component is unusually prominent may lead to a false diagnosis of schizophrenia syndrome. This aspect is illustrated by the case of Miss B. who appears like a psychotic patient without dissociation syndrome and with a hysterical personality. Are the narcoleptics with psychiatric disorders a peculiar sub-type of narcolepsy? Fourty-five percent of our eleven narcoleptics patients have an associated psychiatric disorder. Most of them are depressive. Surprisingly fourty percent of our patients are non-DR2 at the Human Leucocyte Antigen typing. Furthermore seventy five percent of them have an associated psychiatric disorder. This would mean a peculiar sub-type of narcolepsy.,1992.0

In males the rates of onset show a steep increase reaching the maximum value in the age group 15-24 years, followed then by a steady decrease. Females reach the first peak with a clear delay between 20 and 29 years. After the decrease a second smaller peak is observed consistently in females within the age group 45-49 years and over. After having excluded alternative explanations for this gender differences (for example, diagnosis artefacts, sociocultural factors), we hypothesized that the effect of oestradiol on the dopaminergic system enhances the vulnerability threshold for schizophrenia, which is lowered again during the menopause. Alternatively we assumed that testosterone reduces the vulnerability threshold and thus furthers the earlier onset of schizophrenia in males. We tested these hypotheses in animal models by investigating the effects of the gonadal hormones on haloperidol-induced catalepsy and on apomorphine-induced stereotypies in both neonatal and adult rats. Testosterone showed no clear influence on the tested dopamine-mediated behaviour. Oestradiol caused a significant reduction on both dopamine-agonist and dopamine-antagonist induced behaviour. These effects were stronger in neonatal animals. Since oestradiol caused a 2.8-fold reduction of dopamine receptor affinity for sulpiride, we assumed that the behavioural changes caused by oestradiol were accounted for by a down-regulation of the dopaminergic system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992.0

Patients receiving the diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy had excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and polysomnographic findings consistent with narcolepsy but no clinical evidence of cataplexy. Of 28 patients identified, 12 agreed to return for HLA typing. Respondents did not differ from nonrespondents in demographic, clinical, or sleep laboratory data. The comparison group was 503 individuals, those 30 years and older, on the Michigan Kidney Transplant Registry. The odds ratio obtained from logistic regression indicated a strong association between narcolepsy without cataplexy and HLA DR2. To control for potential confounding variables, multivariate models were constructed to explore the joint effects of HLA DR2 and each one of the covariates (age, sex, and race), their possible combinations, and the effect of all three covariates.

The multiple sleep latency test is an objective test of daytime hypersomnia in both diseases. Moreover, if 2 or more REM periods are registered altogether in the 4 or 5 siestas studied, the test is highly suggestive of narcolepsy and permits sure differentiation with idiopathic hypersomnia.

Two hundred consecutive patients who underwent polysomnography over a seven-month period. Their ages ranged from 19 to 77 years.

All patients had diagnostic polysomnography for one night in the sleep laboratory. This involved 12 to 14 physiological variables being monitored continuously overnight by means of a new digital recording and sleep analysis system.

Patients were categorised according to their main sleep disorder or primary diagnosis. Additional sleep disorders in some patients were categorised as secondary diagnoses.

The commonest age group among both male and female patients was 40-49 years. Overall, men outnumbered women three to one. Almost two-thirds of all patients had as their primary diagnosis some degree of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome or simple snoring. The next most common diagnosis was periodic limb movement disorder. The remaining diagnoses included a variety of sleep disorders, from narcolepsy to sleep terrors.

Despite its complexity and time-consuming nature, polysomnography is an essential procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of sleep disorders.

Patients under continuous bedrest slept 2-3 times more during the day than patients who were sitting at the table. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS, stages 3 and 4) were nearly absent during daytime sleep in the table group, but not in the bed group. The differential behavioral regimes during the day resulted in different amounts of SWS in the consecutive night sleep.

Similarities in sleep onsets, REM-specific movement, REM dissociation, ambiguous sleep, nocturnal arousals, diurnal sleep-wake cycles, and relatively limited quiet-awake time are discussed as part of a global inability to inhibit state changes common to both infants and compound narcoleptics. The analogy with infant sleep patterns and results of studies of brain function in narcoleptics suggest that forebrain inhibitory processes are more important in narcoleptic symptomology than is brainstem dysfunction.

The drug history provides important information regarding the role of various medications, which may cause sleep difficulty during their administration or following withdrawal. Implementing a complete medical assessment is necessary for the identification of certain medical conditions that may be associated with sleep disorders. Finally, a thorough psychiatric evaluation and assessment of the psychosocial consequences of the patient's disorder should be conducted.

Symptoms included excessive daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and cataplexy. The diagnosis was confirmed by repeated polysomnographic examinations in the sleep laboratory.

2439565,A diagnostic approach to developmental specific learning disorders.,Weinberg WA; McLean A,1986 Apr,Journal of child neurology,"Children and adolescents who are not doing well in school are often referred to physicians for evaluation. Many of these children have average or above-average intelligence but are academically frustrated, low achievers. Parents state that although they are convinced that their child is bright, he or she does not seem to learn, and does not behave acceptably in school and at home. Results of the usual pediatric and neurologic examinations are frequently unrevealing. In evaluating children who are doing poorly in school, the clinician must determine whether the child has a developmental specific learning disorder and whether primary affective illness, disturbed vigilance, or hyperactivity complicates the picture. Children who are intelligent but failing in school frequently manifest either one or several of these conditions. Although there are reasonably well-established criteria for affective illness in children, clinically useful criteria for evaluating the variety of childhood learning problems have not been available. We present criteria for the diagnosis of developmental specific learning disorders and briefly mention some aspects of management and treatment. We also describe a primary disorder of vigilance that becomes manifest in school, worsening the learning and performance process, which is further worsened by affective illness.",1986.0

The two patient groups were compared with respect to blood pressure, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) psychological profile, nocturnal sleep structure, prevalence and severity of sleep apnea and periodic leg movements in sleep, and daytime sleep tendency. Narcoleptic patients tended to have higher blood pressure, higher prevalence of abnormally elevated MMPI scores, more abbreviated and more disrupted sleep at night, and greater daytime sleep tendency. Sleep apnea and periodic leg movements were more prevalent in narcoleptic patients, but only periodic leg movements in sleep were more prevalent in narcoleptic patients than in the general population. Periodic leg movements during REM sleep were observed in more than one-third of narcoleptic patients, which may be an important pathophysiologic feature of this disorder.",1986.0

All 17 members of a subgroup of the original population were also found to be HLA-Dw2-positive. It was concluded that HLA-DR2 is a prerequisite for the development of narcolepsy and that the diagnosis of narcolepsy can be excluded if HLA-DR2 or HLA-Dw2 is negative. The distinction between idiopathic and symptomatic narcolepsy needs to be reconsidered. (b) Haplotype studies in three families with narcoleptic members enabled detection of children at high risk for narcolepsy. (c) Of the 54 patients with disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness other than narcolepsy, those with essential hypersomnia (EHS) had a higher frequency of HLA-DR2; the others had a lower frequency. The DR2-positive EHS group could include members with an incomplete form of narcolepsy; the DR2-negative EHS group had disorders essentially different from narcolepsy, although both positive and negative groups manifested hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and sleep onset REMs. Two further studies were conducted in subgroups of the original narcoleptic population studied. In a subgroup of 30 patients who underwent lymphocyte subset studies, no T-cell abnormalities were detected; it is unlikely that an autoimmune mechanism is involved in the development of narcolepsy. In a subgroup of 33 narcoleptic patients, Southern's blot analysis of DNA using a DQ beta probe revealed three specific restriction fragments. Further studies are necessary to locate the DNA locus that carries the susceptibility gene for narcolepsy.",1986.0

Based on clinical criteria, 61 patients (42%) were diagnosed as having narcolepsy. Thirty-five narcoleptic patients and five nonnarcoleptic patients exhibited a mean SL less than 5 min, yielding a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 94% for this criterion for pathological drowsiness. The occurrence of two or more SOREMPs was found in 52 narcoleptic patients but in only one nonnarcoleptic patient (sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 99%). Those narcoleptic patients with cataplexy demonstrated a shorter SL and more frequent SOREMPs than their noncataplectic counterparts. It was concluded that the MSLT is a highly reliable laboratory tool for the confirmation of the diagnosis of narcolepsy based on the SOREMP criterion. The criterion value for SL in pathological drowsiness may depend on laboratory conditions as well as the patient population selected.",1985.0

2868518,[Narcolepsy].,Billiard M; Cadilhac J,1985,Revue neurologique,"First described as a separate entity by Gelineau in 1880 and later considered as a symptom, narcolepsy has eventually been recognized as a disease on clinical and polygraphic grounds. Its prevalence stays between 0.04 and 0.06 percent. Age at onset varies from 5 to 50 with a peak in the second decade. Clinical symptoms include excessive daytime somnolence, overwhelming daytime sleep episodes, attacks of cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and disturbed nocturnal sleep; sleep onset REM episodes are the main polygraphic feature. Natural history varies with the different symptoms. Excessive daytime somnolence never subsides completely. Cataplexy may disappear spontaneously. Hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis are not present in all patients and tend to be more transitory. A positive diagnosis of narcolepsy requires a minimum of one major symptom, daytime sleep episodes or cataplexy, together with documented sleep onset REM episodes. Prolonged polygraphic recordings or multiple sleep latency test are of special interest in difficult cases. Clinical variants can be grouped under three headings, incomplete, symptomatic and associated narcolepsies. The etiology of narcolepsy is not well understood. However the discovery of natural animal models of narcolepsy, mainly dogs, has prompted genetic, pharmacological and biochemical studies. The breeding of narcoleptic canine colonies has led to the evidence of a possible autosomal recessive model of inheritance in some species. Pharmacological and neurochemical analysis has shown an imbalance between monoaminergic and cholinergic mechanism. In man, extensive family studies suggest either a two-threshold multifactorial model of inheritance or a dominant mode of inheritance and immunologic studies have recently shown a strong association between HLA-DR2 and narcolepsy. Assays of CSF biogenic amines suggest a decreased bioavailability of dopamine to explain sleepiness and an imbalance between monoamines and acetylcholine to explain cataplexy. A disturbance of circadian rhythms has not been evidenced in narcoleptics. Treatment is still purely symptomatic. Amphetamines and tricyclic antidepressants have been extensively used. However they are not free of side-effects hence the need for alternative treatments.",1985.0

Among the prominent features differentiating patients with insufficient sleep from patients with narcolepsy was the report, obtained on the sleep history, of a disparity between the reported amount of sleep obtained on weekdays versus weekends. On evaluation in the laboratory, patients with insufficient sleep showed atypically high sleep efficiency at night and a prolonged sleep time (longer than they report sleeping on a weekday night at home). Compared with patients with narcolepsy, they show a somewhat elevated percentage of stage 3-4 and REM sleep, although this is probably not higher than that of age-matched controls.

This article has described an approach for the assessment, differential diagnosis, and clinical management of the most prevalent sleep disorders, which are often chronic in nature and have significant psychosocial or medical consequences for the patient and his or her family. We have emphasized the importance for the physician to complement his general medical and diagnostic skills by taking a careful sleep history from the patient (and, in some instances from the bed partner or caretakers). There is no justification for the physician to routinely request costly sleep laboratory hypnopolygraphic evaluations to screen patients with sleep disorders. However, in those instances where the sleep history is highly suggestive of sleep apnea, a sleep laboratory evaluation is indicated. By incorporating the use of the sleep history in the general evaluation of patients with sleep disorders, the physician is better able to develop rational pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches to managing these patients, including the judicious use of medication as an adjunctive treatment.",1982.0

Somnolence may be associated with anxiety, ill-health, and poor or inadequate night-sleep, but also results from a group of sleep disorders including idiopathic hypersomnolence and sleep apnoea. Idiopathic hypersomnolence seems to be a genetic disorder of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep and is distinct from narcolepsy which is a disorder of rapid-eye-movement sleep. Day-time sleepiness in sleep apnoea is probably due to inadequate night sleep. The diagnosis of these disorders depends largely on the history. Treatment of hypersomnia with central stimulant drugs is often unsatisfactory, particularly in the elderly, and tracheostomy rather than medical treatment is sometimes essential in sleep apnoea.",1981.0

Occupational problems were prevalent (over 75%) and included statistically significant deleterious effects upon performance, promotion, earning capacity, fear of or actual job loss and increased disability insurance. Driving was greatly affected and patients fell asleep at the wheel more frequently (66%), had near or actual accidents from drowsiness or falling asleep at the wheel (67%), and could experience cataplexy (29%) or sleep paralysis (12%) while driving.

Significant differences were found between narcoleptic and non-narcoleptic patients in a number of parameters, including EDS severity, mean sleep latency on MSLT, sleep latency on NPSG, latency to REM sleep at night, number of REM sleep at night, number of REM sleep segments throughout the night, the total number of nocturnal myoclonic jerks (as well as the number occurring per hour of NREM and REM sleep), and the number of arousals and wake periods preceded by a myoclonic jerk. Significant differences in sleep latency during MSLT and NPSG testing were found between different EDS diagnostic groups of non-narcoleptic patients. The majority of patients in the MSLT group with long sleep latencies were in the diagnostic groups of EDS associated with psychophysiological and/or psychiatric problems or with drug abuse; patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic central nervous system hypersomnia or EDS associated with disturbed nocturnal sleep formed the majority of the MSLT group with short sleep latencies.

A new clinical specialty has developed with the establishment of sleep disorder centers and a diagnostic classification of sleep and arousal disorders. This new nosological approach has evolved from an extensive base of new scientific information concerning descriptive polygraphic and analysis of clinical case series. Four major categories have been defined: (a) disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (insomnias), (b) disorders of excessive somnolence, (c) disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and (d) dysfunctions associated with sleep. Within this comprehensive classification certain major pathophysiological advances are described for the ""insomnias."" These include polysomnographic identification of altered sleep stage patterns in the major effective illnesses, insomnias related to hypnotic drugs and alcohol, sleep disturbances associated with sleep-induced respiratory impairment, and sleep-related periodic movements during sleep (nocturnal myoclonus). Excessive daytime somnolence is primarily associated with the hypersomnia sleep-apnea syndrome and with narcolepsy. The relationship between biological rhythms (chronobiology) and disorders of the human sleep-wake schedules is very actively investigated. The recognition that sleep length, internal organization, and timing within neurophysiological circadian time-keeping systems has lead to better diagnosis of these sleep-wake disorders and new chronotherapeutic regimens. Finally, increasing identification and description of ""parasomnias,"" i.e. dysfunctions associated with sleep, has led sleep research into important new areas that are of general physiological interest. It is now clear that sleep disorders medicine has become a new scientific and clinical discipline in its own right.",1981.0

Narcoleptic patients also frequently complain of hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, blackouts (or automatic behavior), and disturbed nocturnal sleep. Narcolepsy usually develops in adolescence and is a life-long illness. Symptoms may also appear in young children who may be misdiagnosed as hyperactive or psychotic. No completely satisfactory treatment is available at the present time. The current treatments of choice are methylphenidate (for sleepiness and sleep episodes) and imipramine (for cataplexy).

No current treatment for this neurological disorder is satisfactory and a definitive approach to the disease requires an animal model of narcolepsy. This report summarizes data on a female toy poodle which has a canine form of narcolepsy-cataplexy. At approximately 4 mo of age, the dog presented cataplectic attacks. Physical examination disclosed no systemic factors to account for such atonic episodes. Observation indicated that attacks were frequently partial, involving only the neck musculature and hind legs. However, such attacks could develop into complete cataplexy, causing postural collapse and areflexia, although extrinsic eye muscles and the muscles of respiration were spared. Presentation of food, water, or a plaything were the most frequent elicitors of attacks. During 41 hr of EEG, EOG, and EMG monitoring in conjunction with behavioral observation, the dog exhibited normal polygraphic wakefulness, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. Unambiguous sleep onset REM periods and cataplectic attacks were also observed. These pathological manifestations are analogous to those characteristic of human narcolepsy. The diagnosis of canine narcolepsy was further confirmed by two negative trials with neostigmine (ruling out myasthenia) and two positive trials with imipramine (cataplexy in human narcolepsy responds to imipramine treatment). The dog will be bred either with a littermate or a similarly afflicted male in an attempt to produce a population of afflicted dogs.",1974.0

A diagnosis is made from a careful history. The incidence is estimated as high as 0.3% of the population. Unfortunately patients go for many years before the diagnosis is made and often have experienced disruption of their employment, social and family life, and may have experienced a number of car accidents because of falling asleep at the wheel. An unknown number of narcoleptics kill themselves on the highways before the diagnosis is ever made. Sleep attacks can usually be controlled by methylphenidate, and if the other symptoms persist they can often be effectively managed by imipramine.",1974.0
