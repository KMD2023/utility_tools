<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>1. Sleep. 1991 Dec;14(6):540-5. doi: 10.1093/sleep/14.6.540.<br><br>A new method for measuring daytime sleepiness: the Epworth sleepiness scale.<br><br>Johns MW(1).<br><br>Author information:<br>(1)Sleep Disorders Unit, Epworth Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.<br><br>The development and use of a new scale, the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), is <br>described. This is a simple, self-administered questionnaire which is shown to <br>provide a measurement of the subject's general level of daytime sleepiness. One <br>hundred and eighty adults answered the ESS, including 30 normal men and women as <br>controls and 150 patients with a range of sleep disorders. They rated the <br>chances that they would doze off or fall asleep when in eight different <br>situations commonly encountered in daily life. Total ESS scores significantly <br>distinguished normal subjects from patients in various diagnostic groups <br>including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy and idiopathic <br>hypersomnia. ESS scores were significantly correlated with sleep latency <br>measured during the multiple sleep latency test and during overnight <br>polysomnography. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ESS scores <br>were significantly correlated with the respiratory disturbance index and the <br>minimum SaO2 recorded overnight. ESS scores of patients who simply snored did <br>not differ from controls.<br><br>DOI: 10.1093/sleep/14.6.540<br>PMID: 1798888 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

This paper addresses the complaint of sleepiness <br>objectively by an attempt to differentiate a group of control subjects from a <br>group of patients with unambiguous narcolepsy. Fourteen control and 27 <br>narcoleptic subjects were evaluated by one of three protocols involving <br>nocturnal recordings, detailed interviews, and 5 or more 20-min opportunities to <br>sleep offered at 2-h intervals beginning at 10.00 o'clock, +/- 30 min. Each <br>20-min opportunity to sleep was given to subjects lying in a darkened quiet room <br>and asked to try to fall asleep. Polysomnographic variables were monitored and <br>sleep was scored in 30-sec epochs by standard criteria. The interval from the <br>start of each test to the first epoch of NREM (including stage 1 sleep) or REM <br>sleep was called sleep latency. In two of the protocols, the subjects were <br>awakened immediately after sleep onset. In the third protocol, the subjects were <br>awakened after 10 min of sleep. Narcoleptics consistently fell asleep much more <br>readily than did control subjects. We conclude that the Multiple Sleep latency <br>test, in addition to providing opportunities to clinically document sleep onset <br>REM sleep periods, can demonstrate pathological sleepiness. Based on these data, <br>we suggest that an average sleep latency less than 5 min be set as the minimum <br>cutoff point for pathological sleepiness.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/0013-4694(78)90162-1<br>PMCID: PMC2391074<br>PMID: 81764 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Significant differences were found between narcoleptic and <br>non-narcoleptic patients in a number of parameters, including EDS severity, mean <br>sleep latency on MSLT, sleep latency on NPSG, latency to REM sleep at night, <br>number of REM sleep at night, number of REM sleep segments throughout the night, <br>the total number of nocturnal myoclonic jerks (as well as the number occurring <br>per hour of NREM and REM sleep), and the number of arousals and wake periods <br>preceded by a myoclonic jerk. Significant differences in sleep latency during <br>MSLT and NPSG testing were found between different EDS diagnostic groups of <br>non-narcoleptic patients. The majority of patients in the MSLT group with long <br>sleep latencies were in the diagnostic groups of EDS associated with <br>psychophysiological and/or psychiatric problems or with drug abuse; patients <br>with a diagnosis of idiopathic central nervous system hypersomnia or EDS <br>associated with disturbed nocturnal sleep formed the majority of the MSLT group <br>with short sleep latencies. The non-narcoleptic patients in a MSLT group with <br>short sleep latencies had significantly shorter sleep latencies at night, more <br>sleep cycles, higher sleep efficiency, and earlier REM sleep than patients with <br>long sleep latencies.<br><br>DOI: 10.1093/sleep/4.1.23<br>PMID: 7232969 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Diagnosis and tentative <br>classification.<br><br>Guilleminault C, Dement WC.<br><br>A series of 235 consecutive patients refferred to the Stanford University Sleep <br>Disorders Clinic with the complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) were <br>investigated extensively. A satisfactory final diagnosis involving a consistent <br>syndrome or pathogenic process was made in all but 7 patients. In the course of <br>this work a variety of tests, including prolonged polygraphic monitoring of <br>multiple variables and CSF measurements before and after probenecid ingestion, <br>were utilized. Different syndromes were confirmed (harmonious hypersomnia, <br>subwakefulness syndrome); the definitions of others were clarified and extended <br>(narcolepsy, drug dependency, periodic hypersomnia associated with menstruation, <br>upper airway sleep apnea in children). Two new entities were tentatively <br>identified (narcolepsy with sleep apnea, the neutral state syndrome). Narcolepsy <br>and upper airway sleep apnea accounted for the majority of the cases (199). A <br>strategic schema utilizing specific categories and frequency of occurrence in <br>the case series is presented to improve the diagnosis of the complaint of <br>excessive daytime sleepiness by the practicing physician. This case series was <br>analysed in order to develop tentatively a meaningful nosology.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/0022-510x(77)90003-x<br>PMID: 188992 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The present study was done to <br>examine further the relationship among daytime sleepiness, performance, mood, <br>and nocturnal sleep and to determine if and how these relationships were <br>affected by the nighttime use of benzodiazepine and the ingestion of caffeine in <br>the morning. Subjects received 15 or 30 mg of flurazepam, 0.25 or 0.50 mg of <br>triazolam, or placebo at bedtime and 250 mg of caffeine or placebo in the <br>morning for two treatment days. Two objective (Multiple Sleep Latency Test and <br>lapses) and two subjective (Stanford Sleepiness Scale and Visual Analog Scale) <br>measures of sleepiness, five performance tests, and two mood measures (Profile <br>of Mood Scale and Visual Analog Scale) were administered repeatedly on both <br>days. Electroencephalogram sleep was recorded on both nights. Objective sleep <br>measures of daytime sleepiness were not significantly related to either <br>performance or mood, but subjects with greater daytime sleepiness had <br>significantly longer and more efficient nocturnal sleep. Neither benzodiazepine <br>or caffeine influenced these relationships. In contrast, higher estimates of <br>subjective sleepiness were significantly associated with poorer mood and tended <br>to be related to poorer performance.

Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can mitigate these <br>risks, effectiveness can be reduced by inadequate adherence to treatment. We <br>evaluated the clinical safety and effectiveness of upper-airway stimulation at <br>12 months for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.<br>METHODS: Using a multicenter, prospective, single-group, cohort design, we <br>surgically implanted an upper-airway stimulation device in patients with <br>obstructive sleep apnea who had difficulty either accepting or adhering to CPAP <br>therapy. The primary outcome measures were the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; the <br>number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour, with a score of ≥15 indicating <br>moderate-to-severe apnea) and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI; the number of <br>times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by ≥4 percentage <br>points from baseline). Secondary outcome measures were the Epworth Sleepiness <br>Scale, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and the percentage <br>of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90%. Consecutive participants <br>with a response were included in a randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal <br>trial.<br>RESULTS: The study included 126 participants; 83% were men. The mean age was <br>54.5 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the <br>square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The median AHI score at 12 months <br>decreased 68%, from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour (P&lt;0.001); the <br>ODI score decreased 70%, from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour <br>(P&lt;0.001). Secondary outcome measures showed a reduction in the effects of sleep <br>apnea and improved quality of life. In the randomized phase, the mean AHI score <br>did not differ significantly from the 12-month score in the nonrandomized phase <br>among the 23 participants in the therapy-maintenance group (8.9 and 7.2 events <br>per hour, respectively); the AHI score was significantly higher (indicating more <br>severe apnea) among the 23 participants in the therapy-withdrawal group (25.8 <br>vs. 7.6 events per hour, P&lt;0.001). The ODI results followed a similar pattern. <br>The rate of procedure-related serious adverse events was less than 2%.<br>CONCLUSIONS: In this uncontrolled cohort study, upper-airway stimulation led to <br>significant improvements in objective and subjective measurements of the <br>severity of obstructive sleep apnea.

Measures of nocturnal sleep, respiration during sleep, and daytime <br>sleepiness in 466 patients with apnea were collected to evaluate these two <br>hypotheses. The various parameters were submitted to correlation and multiple <br>regression analyses to predict daytime sleepiness as measured by the MSLT. The <br>RAI, which measures the number of arousals from sleep associated with <br>respiratory disturbances (best fragmentation correlation), produced a higher <br>correlation with MSLT scores than did TMES (best hypoxemia correlation); <br>however, the measures were highly intercorrelated, and multiple regression <br>analyses to determine which parameters independently predicted MSLT showed the <br>single best predictor to be the RAI. Additional independent variance in MSLT <br>score was explained by TST and PSG1. Measures of hypoxemia provided little or no <br>independent predictive information. These data support the hypothesis that sleep <br>fragmentation is an important determinant of daytime sleepiness in patients with <br>apnea.<br><br>DOI: 10.1378/chest.95.6.1202<br>PMID: 2721252 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

When the effects of age and time of day were partialed <br>out, PLR data suggest that increased sleepiness as measured by MSLT is <br>significantly correlated with increased parasympathetic activity (r = -0.60, p <br>less than 0.01) and not with decreased sympathetic activity (r = -0.24, not <br>significant).

These <br>partial correlations were significantly different (p less than 0.02). In the <br>group of sleep apnea patients, the PLR suggests that increased number of apneas <br>and hypopneas (sleep fragmentation) was significantly correlated with both <br>decreased sympathetic activity and increased parasympathetic activity.

This is a <br>self-administered questionnaire, the item scores from which provide a new method <br>for measuring SPs in eight different real-life situations. The ESS item scores <br>were analyzed separately in four groups of subjects: 150 adult patients with a <br>variety of sleep disorders, 87 medical students who answered the ESS on two <br>occasions 5 months apart, 44 patients who also had MSLTs and 50 patients whose <br>spouses also answered the ESS about their partner's sleepiness.

Three of the <br>most commonly used tests: the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), the <br>maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) <br>give results that are significantly correlated in a statistical sense, but are <br>not closely related. The purpose of this investigation was to help clarify this <br>problem. Previously published data from several investigations were used to <br>calculate the reference range of normal values for each test, defined by the <br>mean+/-2 SD or by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. The 'rule of thumb' that many <br>people rely on to interpret MSLT results is shown here to be misleading. <br>Previously published results from each test were also available for narcoleptic <br>patients who were drug-free at the time and who by definition had EDS. This <br>enabled the sensitivity and specificity of the three tests to be compared for <br>the first time, in their ability to distinguish the EDS of narcolepsy from the <br>daytime sleepiness of normal subjects. The receiver operator characteristic <br>curves clearly showed that the ESS is the most discriminating test, the MWT is <br>next best and the MSLT the least discriminating test of daytime sleepiness. The <br>MSLT can no longer be considered the gold standard for such tests.<br><br>DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2869.2000.00177.x<br>PMID: 10733683 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Mean sleep latency ranged from 2 to 20 min within each group, but <br>the shape of the distribution of latency between groups was different. The mean <br>latency of young subjects (particularly college students) was shorter than that <br>of the older subjects, with the differences occurring between the sleepiest 80% <br>of each distribution. Among the college students, those with higher nocturnal <br>sleep efficiencies (the previous night) were sleepier the following day than <br>those with lower sleep efficiencies. The relation between nocturnal sleep <br>efficiency and daytime sleepiness suggests that the increased sleepiness of <br>average young adults is due to mild sleep restriction.<br><br>PMID: 3363268 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Topics include the importance of <br>reliability and validity, psychometric approaches used to provide reliability <br>and validity estimates, the kinds of evidence needed to indicate that a PRO has <br>a sufficient level of reliability and validity, contexts that may affect <br>psychometric properties, methods available to evaluate PRO instruments when the <br>context varies, and types of reliability and validity testing that are <br>appropriate during different phases of clinical trials. Points discussed include <br>the perspective that the psychometric properties of reliability and validity are <br>on a continuum in which the more evidence one has, the greater confidence there <br>is in the value of the PRO data. Construct validity is the type of validity most <br>frequently used with PRO instruments as few "gold standards" exist to allow the <br>use of criterion validity and content validity by itself only provides beginning <br>evidence of validity. Several guidelines are recommended for establishing <br>sufficient evidence of reliability and validity. For clinical trials, a minimum <br>reliability threshold of 0.70 is recommended. Sample sizes for testing should <br>include at least 200 cases and results should be replicated in at least one <br>additional sample. At least one full report on the development of the instrument <br>and one on the use of the instrument are deemed necessary to evaluate the PRO <br>psychometric properties. Psychometric testing ideally occurs before the <br>initiation of Phase III trials. When testing does not occur prior to a Phase III <br>trial, considerable risk is posed in relation to the ability to substantiate the <br>use of the PRO data. Various qualitative (e.g., focus groups, behavioral coding, <br>cognitive interviews) and quantitative approaches (e.g., differential item <br>functioning testing) are useful in evaluating the reliability and validity of <br>PRO instruments.<br><br>DOI: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00272.x<br>PMID: 17995479 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Those individuals with either insomnia or excessive <br>sleepiness and who were currently working rotating or night schedules were <br>classified as having shift work sleep disorder. Occupational, behavioral, and <br>health-related outcomes were also measured. Individuals who met criteria for <br>shift work sleep disorder had significantly higher rates of ulcers (odds ratio = <br>4.18, 95% confidence interval = 2.00-8.72), sleepiness-related accidents, <br>absenteeism, depression, and missed family and social activities more frequently <br>compared to those shift workers who did not meet criteria (P &lt; .05). <br>Importantly, in most cases, the morbidity associated with shift work sleep <br>disorder was significantly greater than that experienced by day workers with <br>identical symptoms.<br>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that individuals with shift work sleep <br>disorder are at risk for significant behavioral and health-related morbidity <br>associated with their sleep-wake symptomatology. Further, it suggests that the <br>prevalence of shift work sleep disorder is approximately 10% of the night and <br>rotating shift work population.<br><br>DOI: 10.1093/sleep/27.8.1453<br>PMID: 15683134 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Surveys of the prevalence of sleepy behavior in drivers <br>suggest that sleepiness may be a more common cause of highway crashes than is <br>reflected in these estimates. About 96% of sleep-related crashes involve <br>passenger vehicle drivers and 3% involve drivers of large trucks. Risk factors <br>include youth, shift work, alcohol and other drug use, over-the-counter and <br>prescription medications, and sleep disorders.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness of the relationship between sleepiness and <br>motor vehicle crashes will promote the health and safety of drivers and highway <br>users. Physicians can contribute by encouraging good sleep habits, recognizing <br>and treating sleep-related problems, and counseling patients about the risks of <br>driving while sleepy. To protect public health and safety, the American Medical <br>Association recommends continued research on devices and technologies to detect <br>the signs of sleepiness and prevent the deterioration of driver alertness and <br>performance. Educational programs about the risks of falling asleep while <br>driving are needed for physicians, the public, and commercial truck drivers.<br><br>DOI: 10.1001/jama.279.23.1908<br>PMID: 9634264 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The ESS-BR was applied to a group of patients who were submitted to <br>overnight polysomnography in order to identify obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea <br>syndrome (OSAHS), insomnia and primary snoring.

A high <br>prevalence of medical and psychosocial comorbidities and the frequent use of <br>multiple medications, rather than aging per se, are major reasons for this. A <br>major concern, often underappreciated and underaddressed by clinicians, is the <br>strong bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and serious medical <br>problems in older adults. Hypertension, depression, cardiovascular disease, and <br>cerebrovascular disease are examples of diseases that are more likely to develop <br>in individuals with sleep disorders. Conversely, individuals with any of these <br>diseases are at a higher risk of developing sleep disorders. The goals of this <br>article are to help guide clinicians in their general understanding of sleep <br>problems in older persons, examine specific sleep disorders that occur in older <br>persons, and suggest evidence- and expert-based recommendations for the <br>assessment and treatment of sleep disorders in older persons. No such <br>recommendations are available to help clinicians in their daily patient care <br>practices. The four sections in the beginning of the article are titled, <br>Background and Significance, General Review of Sleep, Recommendations <br>Development, and General Approach to Detecting Sleep Disorders in an Ambulatory <br>Setting. These are followed by overviews of specific sleep disorders: Insomnia, <br>Sleep Apnea, Restless Legs Syndrome, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders, <br>Parasomnias, Hypersomnias, and Sleep Disorders in Long-Term Care Settings. <br>Evidence- and expert- based recommendations, developed by a group of sleep and <br>clinical experts, are presented after each sleep disorder.<br><br>DOI: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2009.02220.x<br>PMCID: PMC2748127<br>PMID: 19484833 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

We compared four driving schedules, two in the United <br>States (five 10-hour trips of day driving beginning about the same time each day <br>or of night driving beginning about 2 hours earlier each day) and two in Canada <br>(four 13-hour trips of late-night-to-morning driving beginning at about the same <br>time each evening or of afternoon-to-night driving beginning 1 hour later each <br>day).<br>RESULTS: Drivers averaged 5.18 hours in bed per. day and 4.78 hours of <br>electrophysiologically verified sleep per day over the five-day study (range, <br>3.83 hours of sleep for those on the steady 13-hour night schedule to 5.38 hours <br>of sleep for those on the steady 10-hour day schedule). These values compared <br>with a mean (+/-SD) self-reported ideal amount of sleep of 7.1+/-1 hours a day. <br>For 35 drivers (44 percent), naps augmented the sleep obtained by an average of <br>0.45+/-0.31 hour. No crashes or other vehicle mishaps occurred. Two drivers had <br>undiagnosed sleep apnea, as detected by polysomnography. Two other drivers had <br>one episode each of stage 1 sleep while driving, as detected by <br>electroencephalography. Forty-five drivers (56 percent) had at least 1 <br>six-minute interval of drowsiness while driving, as judged by analysis of video <br>recordings of their faces; 1067 of the 1989 six-minute segments (54 percent) <br>showing drowsy drivers involved just eight drivers.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Long-haul truck drivers in this study obtained less sleep than is <br>required for alertness on the job. The greatest vulnerability to sleep or <br>sleep-like states is in the late night and early morning.<br><br>DOI: 10.1056/NEJM199709113371106<br>PMCID: PMC2430925<br>PMID: 9287232 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The aim of this study was to evaluate fatigue <br>more comprehensively, considering relationships with psychological and <br>biological factors simultaneously in a population-based IBD community sample.<br>METHODS: Manitoba IBD Cohort Study participants (n = 318; 51% Crohn's disease <br>[CD]) were assessed by survey, interview, and blood sample. Fatigue, sleep <br>quality, daytime drowsiness, stress, psychological distress, and quality of life <br>were measured with validated scales. Hemoglobin (Hg) and C-reactive protein <br>(CRP) levels were also obtained. Differences were tested across disease activity <br>and disease subtype.<br>RESULTS: Elevated CRP was found for 23% of the sample and 12% were anemic; 46% <br>had active disease. Overall, 72% of those with active and 30% with inactive <br>disease reached clinical thresholds for fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue <br>Inventory; P &lt; 0.001); 77% and 49% of those with active or inactive disease, <br>respectively, experienced poor sleep (P &lt; 0.001). There were few differences <br>between those with CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) on the factors assessed, <br>except for higher CRP levels in CD (mean 8.8 versus 5.3, P &lt; 0.02). Multiple <br>logistic regression analyses found that elevated fatigue was associated with <br>active disease (odds ratio [OR] 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-7.8), poor <br>sleep quality (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.9-8.6), and perceived stress (OR 4.2, 95% CI <br>2.2-8.1), but not with hours of sleep, Hg, or CRP.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and poor sleep are not only highly prevalent in active <br>disease, but both are still significant concerns for many with inactive disease. <br>Psychological factors are associated with fatigue in IBD in addition to disease <br>and sleep considerations.<br><br>Copyright © 2010 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.<br><br>DOI: 10.1002/ibd.21580<br>PMID: 21830266 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

However, current understanding of NMS is incomplete, <br>particularly as a result of the absence of standardisation of outcome <br>definitions and the heterogeneity of the risk factors that are assessed. The <br>best data on risk factors for NMS in Parkinson's disease come from longitudinal <br>studies, with the strongest evidence identifying factors for cognitive <br>impairment and dementia, hallucinations, depression, apathy, excessive daytime <br>sleepiness, insomnia, and impulse-control disorders. Cognitive impairment, <br>hallucinations, and depression have several common risk factors, and many other <br>NMS share a few risk factors, showing the interdependence between NMS with <br>advancing Parkinson's disease. Disease severity, sex, age, and antiparkinsonian <br>medication might have roles in the development of different NMS, although only <br>antiparkinsonian medication is potentially modifiable. Until disease-modifying <br>therapies are developed, increased knowledge of risk factors could ameliorate <br>early identification of patients who are at an increased risk of developing <br>specific NMS and potentially allow improvement of symptom management or <br>prevention of specific NMS.<br><br>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effect of OSA on ventricular function, especially diastolic <br>function, is not clear. Therefore, we have assessed the prevalence of diastolic <br>dysfunction in patients with OSA and the relationship between diastolic <br>parameters and severity of OSA.<br>METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive patients with OSA confirmed by polysomnography <br>underwent echocardiography. Diastolic function of the left ventricle was <br>determined by transmitral valve pulse-wave Doppler echocardiography. Various <br>baseline characteristics, severity of OSA, and echocardiographic parameters were <br>compared between patients with and without diastolic dysfunction.<br>RESULTS: There were 61 male and 7 female patients with a mean age of 48.1 +/- <br>11.1 years, body mass index of 28.5 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2), and apnea/hypopnea index <br>(AHI) of 44.3 +/- 23.2/h (mean +/- SD). An abnormal relaxation pattern (ARP) in <br>diastole was noted in 25 patients (36.8%). Older age (52.7 +/- 8.9 years vs 45.1 <br>+/- 11.3 years, p = 0.005), hypertension (56% vs 20%, p = 0.002), and a lower <br>minimum pulse oximetric saturation (SpO(2)) during sleep (70.5 +/- 17.9% vs 78.8 <br>+/- 12.9%, respectively; p = 0.049) were more common in patients with ARP. By <br>multivariate analysis, minimum SpO(2) &lt; 70% was an independent predictor of ARP <br>(odds ratio, 4.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 15.25; p = 0.02) <br>irrespective of age and hypertension. Patients with AHI &gt; or = 40/h had <br>significantly longer isovolumic relaxation times than those with AHI &lt; 40/h (106 <br>+/- 19 ms vs 93 +/- 17 ms, respectively; p = 0.005).<br>CONCLUSION: Diastolic dysfunction with ARP was common in patients with OSA.

The ARCES was found to be associated <br>with a more direct measure of propensity to attention lapses (Mindful Attention <br>Awareness Scale--MAAS) and to errors on an existing behavioral measure of <br>sustained attention (Sustained Attention to Response Task--SART). Although the <br>ARCES and MAAS were highly correlated, structural modelling revealed the ARCES <br>was more directly related to SART errors and the MAAS to SART RTs, which have <br>been hypothesized to directly reflect the lapses of attention that lead to SART <br>errors. Thus, the MAAS and SART RTs appear to directly reflect attention lapses, <br>whereas the ARCES and SART errors reflect the mistakes these lapses are thought <br>to cause. Boredom proneness was also assessed by the BPS, as a separate <br>consequence of a propensity to attention lapses. Although the ARCES was <br>significantly associated with the BPS, this association was entirely accounted <br>for by the MAAS, suggesting that performance errors and boredom are separate <br>consequences of lapses in attention. A tendency to even extraordinarily brief <br>attention lapses on the order of milliseconds may have far-reaching consequences <br>not only for safe and efficient task performance but also for sustaining the <br>motivation to persist in and enjoy these tasks.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/j.concog.2005.11.009<br>PMID: 16427318 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

CBT-I was <br>superior to the waitlist control condition in all sleep diary outcomes and in <br>polysomnography-measured total sleep time. Compared to waitlist participants, <br>CBT-I participants reported improved subjective sleep (41% full remission versus <br>0%), disruptive nocturnal behaviors (based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality <br>Index-Addendum), and overall work and interpersonal functioning. These effects <br>were maintained at 6-mo follow-up. Both CBT-I and waitlist control participants <br>reported reductions in PTSD symptoms and CAPS-measured nightmares.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improved sleep in <br>individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder, with durable gains at 6 mo. <br>Overall psychosocial functioning improved following CBT-I. The initial evidence <br>regarding CBT-I and nightmares is promising but further research is needed. <br>Results suggest that a comprehensive approach to treatment of posttraumatic <br>stress disorder should include behavioral sleep medicine.<br>CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: TRIAL NAME: Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Of <br>Insomnia In Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

Untreated sleep disorders <br>among police officers may adversely affect their health and safety and pose a <br>risk to the public.<br>OBJECTIVE: To quantify associations between sleep disorder risk and <br>self-reported health, safety, and performance outcomes in police officers.<br>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional and prospective cohort study <br>of North American police officers participating in either an online or an <br>on-site screening (n=4957) and monthly follow-up surveys (n=3545 officers <br>representing 15,735 person-months) between July 2005 and December 2007. A total <br>of 3693 officers in the United States and Canada participated in the online <br>screening survey, and 1264 officers from a municipal police department and a <br>state police department participated in the on-site survey.<br>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comorbid health conditions (cross-sectional); performance <br>and safety outcomes (prospective).<br>RESULTS: Of the 4957 participants, 40.4% screened positive for at least 1 sleep <br>disorder, most of whom had not been diagnosed previously. Of the total cohort, <br>1666 (33.6%) screened positive for obstructive sleep apnea, 281 (6.5%) for <br>moderate to severe insomnia, 269 (5.4%) for shift work disorder (14.5% of those <br>who worked the night shift). Of the 4608 participants who completed the <br>sleepiness scale, 1312 (28.5%) reported excessive sleepiness. Of the total <br>cohort, 1294 (26.1%) reported falling asleep while driving at least 1 time a <br>month. Respondents who screened positive for obstructive sleep apnea or any <br>sleep disorder had an increased prevalence of reported physical and mental <br>health conditions, including diabetes, depression, and cardiovascular disease. <br>An analysis of up to 2 years of monthly follow-up surveys showed that those <br>respondents who screened positive for a sleep disorder vs those who did not had <br>a higher rate of reporting that they had made a serious administrative error <br>(17.9% vs 12.7%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.43 [95% CI, 1.23-1.67]); of falling <br>asleep while driving (14.4% vs 9.2%; adjusted OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.20-1.90]); of <br>making an error or safety violation attributed to fatigue (23.7% vs 15.5%; <br>adjusted OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.43-1.85]); and of exhibiting other adverse <br>work-related outcomes including uncontrolled anger toward suspects (34.1% vs <br>28.5%; adjusted OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.09-1.43]), absenteeism (26.0% vs 20.9%; <br>adjusted OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.08-1.40]), and falling asleep during meetings <br>(14.1% vs 7.0%; adjusted OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.52-2.52]).<br>CONCLUSION: Among a group of North American police officers, sleep disorders <br>were common and were significantly associated with increased risk of <br>self-reported adverse health, performance, and safety outcomes.<br><br>DOI: 10.1001/jama.2011.1851<br>PMID: 22187276 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Yet no Mandarin-Chinese <br>translation has ever reported its validation data. In this study we translated <br>and validated the ESS into Mandarin Chinese (CESS). We found, in 31 bilingual <br>patients' responses to the CESS and the English ESS obtained 1-2 weeks apart did <br>not differ significantly (10.5 +/- 3.7 vs. 9.6 +/- 3.9, p = 0.32, Wilcoxon's <br>signed rank test) and were significantly correlated (Spearman's p = 0.67, p = <br>0.0004). A total of 359 sleep-disordered breathing subjects were enrolled into <br>the validation study in a prospective manner. The CESS showed acceptable <br>internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81). Thirty out of these patients <br>answered CESS twice at an interval of 2-4 weeks, to yield an acceptable level of <br>test-retest reliability (p = 0.74, p = 0.001). The respiratory disturbance <br>indices obtained from 251 out of 359 subjects were significantly correlated with <br>their CESS scores (p = 0.22, p &lt; 0.001). The standard response mean of CESS was <br>0.86 as obtained from 94 out of 359 subjects who had initial control of their <br>symptoms at 3 months after radio-frequency palate surgery. We conclude that the <br>CESS is reliable in both a linguistic and a test-retest sense, and appears to be <br>valid and sensitive to clinical change. The CESS could be used to advantage <br>among other Mandarin-speaking subjects as a standardised screening test of <br>sleepiness in daily life.<br><br>DOI: 10.1023/a:1020818417949<br>PMID: 12482165 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

However, studies based on self-report have been unable to identify <br>an association in older populations. In this study, the cross-sectional <br>associations between sleep duration measured objectively and measures of weight <br>and body composition were assessed in two cohorts of older adults.<br>METHODS: Wrist actigraphy was performed for a mean (s.d.) of 5.2 (0.9) nights in <br>3055 men (age: 67-96 years) participating in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men <br>Study (MrOS) and 4.1 (0.8) nights in 3052 women (age: 70-99 years) participating <br>in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). A subgroup of 2862 men and 455 <br>women also underwent polysomnography to measure sleep apnea severity.<br>RESULTS: Compared to those sleeping an average of 7-8 h per night, and after <br>adjusting for multiple risk factors and medical conditions, a sleep duration of <br>less than 5 h was associated with a body mass index (BMI) that was on average <br>2.5 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-2.9) greater in men and 1.8 <br>kg/m(2) (95% CI: 1.1-2.4) greater in women. The odds of obesity (BMI &gt;or= 30 <br>kg/m(2)) was 3.7-fold greater (95% CI: 2.7-5.0) in men and 2.3-fold greater in <br>women (95% CI: 1.6-3.1) who slept less than 5 h. Short sleep was also associated <br>with central body fat distribution and increased percent body fat. These <br>associations persisted after adjusting for sleep apnea, insomnia and daytime <br>sleepiness.<br>CONCLUSIONS: In older men and women, actigraphy-ascertained reduced sleep <br>durations are strongly associated with greater adiposity.<br><br>DOI: 10.1038/ijo.2008.198<br>PMCID: PMC2605208<br>PMID: 18936766 [Indexed for MEDLINE]<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: Disclosures: Drs.

The purposes of <br>this study were to test the hypothesis that the Korean version of the ESS (KESS) <br>is valid and evaluate its usefulness.<br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the KESS, which involved translating into <br>Korean and then translating back into English to check its accuracy. A total of <br>273 participants (181 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-37 mild, 61 moderate, 83 <br>severe, 32 simple snoring and 60 normal) were included in this study. All <br>subjects completed the overnight polysomnograph and 53 of the total subjects <br>were randomly selected for a retest with the questionnaire approximately 2∼4 <br>weeks later. The associations between KESS and the degree of OSA were examined <br>through ANCOVA, adjusted for age, sex and BMI.<br>RESULTS: The total score and each item's score of KESS in patients with OSA were <br>significantly higher than subjects with normal controls (p &lt; 0.01). As the <br>severity of OSA increased, the KESS showed significantly increasing patterns (p <br>for trend &lt;0.01). The KESS in patient groups showed good internal consistency <br>(Cronbach's α = 0.90) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.78 to 0.93).<br>CONCLUSION: The KESS is a reliable and valid tool for screening patients with <br>daytime sleepiness in Korea.<br><br>DOI: 10.1007/s11325-010-0343-6<br>PMID: 20358406 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group.<br><br>[No authors listed]<br><br>Narcolepsy is a central nervous system disorder characterized by excessive <br>daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. This placebo-controlled, double-blind, <br>randomized, parallel-group, 18-center study assessed the efficacy and safety of <br>modafinil, a new wake-promoting drug for treating sleepiness in narcolepsy. <br>Subjects with narcolepsy (n = 283) received daily modafinil, 200 or 400 mg, or <br>placebo, for 9 weeks, followed by an open-label treatment period. Subjective <br>sleepiness was measured with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Objective sleepiness <br>was assessed with the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of <br>Wakefulness Test. Level of illness was measured with the Clinical Global <br>Impression of Change. Modafinil significantly reduced all measures of sleepiness <br>and was associated with significant improvements in level of illness. <br>Medication-related adverse experiences were few, dose-dependent, and mostly <br>rated mild to moderate. Modafinil taken once daily was a very well tolerated and <br>effective wake-promoting agent in the treatment of excessive daytime somnolence <br>associated with narcolepsy. Modafinil demonstrated an excellent safety profile <br>for up to 40 weeks of open-label treatment and efficacy was maintained, <br>suggesting that tolerance will not develop with long-term use.

When multiple similar studies were available, <br>random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.<br>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve <br>(AUC), AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, blood pressure, mortality, <br>cardiovascular events, motor vehicle crashes, quality of life, and harms.<br>RESULTS: A total of 110 studies were included (N = 46 188). No RCTs compared <br>screening with no screening. In 2 studies (n = 702), the screening accuracy of <br>the multivariable apnea prediction score followed by home portable monitor <br>testing for detecting severe OSA syndrome (AHI ≥30 and ESS score &gt;10) was AUC <br>0.80 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.90), respectively, but <br>the studies oversampled high-risk participants and those with OSA and OSA <br>syndrome. No studies prospectively evaluated screening tools to report <br>calibration or clinical utility for improving health outcomes. Meta-analysis <br>found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with sham was <br>significantly associated with reduction of AHI (weighted mean difference [WMD], <br>-33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 to -25.6]; 13 trials, 543 participants), excessive <br>sleepiness assessed by ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.4]; 22 trials, <br>2721 participants), diurnal systolic blood pressure (WMD, -2.4 points [95% CI, <br>-3.9 to -0.9]; 15 trials, 1190 participants), and diurnal diastolic blood <br>pressure (WMD, -1.3 points [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 trials, 1190 <br>participants). CPAP was associated with modest improvement in sleep-related <br>quality of life (Cohen d, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42]; 13 trials, 2325 <br>participants). Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) and weight loss programs <br>were also associated with reduced AHI and excessive sleepiness. Common adverse <br>effects of CPAP and MADs included oral or nasal dryness, irritation, and pain, <br>among others. In cohort studies, there was a consistent association between AHI <br>and all-cause mortality.<br>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical <br>utility of all potential screening tools. Multiple treatments for OSA reduce <br>AHI, ESS scores, and blood pressure. Trials of CPAP and other treatments have <br>not established whether treatment reduces mortality or improves most other <br>health outcomes, except for modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life.<br><br>DOI: 10.1001/jama.2016.19635<br>PMID: 28118460 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The aim of this study was to investigate the <br>reliability and validity of the ESS in the Turkish language. The Turkish version <br>of the ESS (ESStr) was applied to 194 healthy controls and 150 consecutive <br>subjects attending the sleep centre with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. <br>Test-retest reliability of the ESStr was tested in a separate group of 30 <br>subjects. The ESStr scores of 60 subjects with mild to severe obstructive sleep <br>apnoea (OSA) were compared with the ESStr scores of 60 healthy controls matched <br>for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). Concurrent validity with the <br>Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQtr) was also assessed in 12 <br>subjects. The questionnaire had a high level of internal consistency as measured <br>by Cronbach's alpha (&gt; or =0.86). The test-retest intraclass correlation <br>coefficient was r = 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.64-0.90) (p &lt; 0.001) and <br>Spearman's correlation coefficient was r = 0.80 (p = 0.01). The control group <br>had lower ESStr scores than subjects with sleep-disordered breathing (3.6 +/- 3 <br>vs 12.6 +/- 6, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Subjects with mild sleep-disordered <br>breathing also had lower scores of the ESStr than those with moderate and severe <br>sleep-disordered breathing (10 +/- 6.2 vs 14 +/- 5. and 10 +/- 6.2 vs 16 +/- <br>5.4, respectively; both p &lt; 0.05), but there were no significant differences <br>between moderate and severe subjects with sleep apnoea. There were significant <br>correlations between the ESStr and total FOSQtr and its subscales (r = -0.22 to <br>r = -0.92; all p = 0.05). Factor analysis of item scores showed that the ESStr <br>had only one factor. The ESStr is a reliable and valid measure of daytime <br>sleepiness. These features and the simplicity of the ESStr make it a valuable <br>measure for clinical management and research.<br><br>DOI: 10.1007/s11325-007-0145-7<br>PMID: 17922157 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

On the other hand, some <br>experts have claimed that our core, basic amount of sleep is around 6 h per <br>night, and that the rest of our sleep can be easily curtailed, being unnecessary <br>to fulfill any sleep need. However, experimental data on the effects of both <br>acute and cumulative partial sleep deprivation (PSD) consistently point out that <br>sleep restriction has substantial negative effects on sleepiness, motor and <br>cognitive performance and mood, as well as on some metabolic, hormonal and <br>immunological variables. As chronic PSD may have serious long-term adverse <br>health effects, it should be avoided in the general population. In the <br>short-term, the effects of sleep curtailment seem to accumulate linearly, while <br>the effects of long-term PSD should be further investigated, as the few <br>available studies are flawed by methodological weaknesses. On the other hand, <br>there is evidence that extending sleep by 2-3 h beyond the norm produces only <br>marginal benefits for an average individual. Finally, it is underlined that, as <br>large individual differences do exist in the need for sleep, the search for the <br>sleep need may be vain. A somnotypology, taking into account age, gender and the <br>position in both the sleep-alert and the morningness-eveningness continuum, <br>should help in the search for the actual individual sleep need. 2001 Harcourt <br>Publishers Ltd<br><br>DOI: 10.1053/smrv.2000.0138<br>PMID: 12531052</p>

Nine hundred and eight three consecutive subjects entering the <br>Stanford Sleep Disorder Clinic completed the questionnaire. Clinic physicians <br>reported on the presence or absence of "clear-cut" cataplexy. Responses to 51 <br>cataplexy-related questionnaire items were compared between subjects with <br>clear-cut cataplexy (n = 63) and all other patients (n = 920). As previously <br>reported, a large portion of the non-narcoleptic population was found to <br>experience muscle weakness with various intense emotions (1.8% to 18.0%) or <br>athletic activities (26.2% to 28.8%). Factor analysis and Receiver Operating <br>Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis were used to determine the most predictive <br>items for clear-cut cataplexy. Most strikingly, cataplexy was best <br>differentiated from other types of muscle weakness when triggered by only three <br>typical situations: "when hearing and telling a joke," "while laughing," or <br>"when angry." Face or neck, rather than limbs, were also more specifically <br>involved in clear-cut cataplexy. Other items, such as length of attacks, <br>bilaterality, and alteration in consciousness, were poorly predictive. A simple <br>decision tree was constructed to isolate high-(91.7%) and low-(0.6%) risk groups <br>for cataplexy. This questionnaire will be used to increase diagnostic <br>consistency across clinical centers, thus providing more homogenous subject <br>pools for clinical and basic research studies.<br><br>PMID: 9989368 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Here we report on the <br>construction and testing of the developer-authorized Japanese version of the ESS <br>(JESS).<br>METHODS: Developing the JESS involved translations, back translations, a pilot <br>study, and psychometric testing. We identified questions in the ESS that were <br>difficult to answer or were inappropriate in Japan, proposed possible <br>replacements for those questions, and tested them with analyses based on item <br>response theory (IRT) and classical test theory. The subjects were healthy <br>people and patients with narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, or obstructive <br>sleep apnea syndrome.<br>RESULTS: We identified two of our proposed questions as appropriate replacements <br>for two problematic questions in the ESS. The JESS had very few missing data. <br>Internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability were high. The <br>patients had significantly higher JESS scores than did the healthy people, and <br>higher JESS scores were associated with worse daytime function, as measured with <br>the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.<br>CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, the JESS provides reliable and valid information on <br>daytime sleepiness.

Outcomes were assessed <br>at baseline, the end of 8 sessions of treatment, and 6 months later. This pilot <br>was conducted to determine initial feasibility and generate effect size <br>estimates.<br>RESULTS: During the 6-month follow-up, the CBTI-BP group had fewer days in a <br>bipolar episode relative to the PE group (3.3 days vs. 25.5 days). The CBTI-BP <br>group also experienced a significantly lower hypomania/mania relapse rate (4.6% <br>vs. 31.6%) and a marginally lower overall mood episode relapse rate (13.6% vs. <br>42.1%) compared with the PE group. Relative to PE, CBTI-BP reduced insomnia <br>severity and led to higher rates of insomnia remission at posttreatment and <br>marginally higher rates at 6 months. Both CBTI-BP and PE showed statistically <br>significant improvement on selected sleep and functional impairment measures. <br>The effects of treatment were well sustained through follow-up for most <br>outcomes, although some decline on secondary sleep benefits was observed.<br>CONCLUSIONS: CBTI-BP was associated with reduced risk of mood episode relapse <br>and improved sleep and functioning on certain outcomes in bipolar disorder. <br>Hence, sleep disturbance appears to be an important pathway contributing to <br>bipolar disorder. The need to develop bipolar disorder-specific sleep diary <br>scoring standards is highlighted.<br><br>(c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).<br><br>DOI: 10.1037/a0038655<br>PMCID: PMC4446240<br>PMID: 25622197 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Stable doses of stimulants were permitted. Subjects were randomized <br>in blinded fashion to receive 3, 6, or 9 g doses of sodium oxybate or placebo <br>taken in equally divided doses upon retiring to bed and 2.5-4 hours later for 4 <br>weeks.<br>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Disease symptoms and adverse events were recorded in <br>daily diaries. The primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline in <br>weekly cataplexy attacks. Secondary measures included daytime sleepiness using <br>the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), inadvertent daytime naps/sleep attacks and <br>nighttime awakenings. Investigators assessed changes in disease severity using <br>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-c). Compared to placebo, weekly <br>cataplexy attacks were decreased by sodium oxybate at the 6 g dose (p=0.0529) <br>and significantly at the 9 g dose (p=0.0008). The ESS was reduced at all doses, <br>becoming significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0001). The CGI-c demonstrated a <br>dose-related improvement, significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0002). The frequency <br>of inadvertent naps/sleep attacks and the nighttime awakenings showed similar <br>dose-response trends, becoming significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0122 and <br>p=0.0035, respectively).

A variety of scales have been applied to the evaluation of PD sleep and <br>wakefulness, but only a small number have been assessed specifically for <br>clinimetric properties in the PD population. The movement disorder society has <br>commissioned this task force to examine these scales and to assess their use in <br>PD. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the use of sleep <br>scales in PD and to determine which scales qualified for a detailed critique. <br>The task force members, all of whom have extensive experience in assessing sleep <br>in PD reviewed each of the scales using a structured proforma. Scales were <br>categorized into recommended, suggested and listed according to predefined <br>criteria. A total of 48 potential scales were identified from the search and <br>reviewed. Twenty-nine were excluded because they did not meet review criteria or <br>were variations of scales already included, leaving 19 scales that were <br>critiqued and rated by the task force based on the rating criteria. Only six <br>were found to meet criteria for recommendation or suggestion by the task force: <br>the PD sleep scale (PDSS) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) are <br>recommended for rating overall sleep problems to screen and to measure severity, <br>the SCOPA-sleep (SCOPA) is recommended for rating overall sleep problems both to <br>screen and to measure severity, and for rating daytime sleepiness; the Epworth <br>sleepiness scale (ESS) is recommended for rating daytime sleepiness to screen <br>and to measure severity; the inappropriate sleep composite score (ISCS) is <br>suggested for rating severe daytime sleepiness or sleep attacks to screen and to <br>measure severity; and the Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS) is suggested for <br>rating sleepiness and to measure severity at a specific moment.

The <br>clinical presentation of sleep disordered breathing in females differs from <br>males and can vary with age and physiological status, e.g. menopause and <br>pregnancy. Overall, females appear to be more symptomatic, with lower <br>apnoea-hypopnoea index scores compared to males. Furthermore, they appear to <br>have more prolonged partial upper airway obstruction, and may report insomnia as <br>a symptom of OSAHS more frequently. As a consequence of these differences in <br>clinical presentation, females with sleep disordered breathing are often <br>underdiagnosed and undertreated compared to males.

However, a long delay <br>until diagnosis has been consistently reported in the literature across <br>countries and several publications have focused on characterizing this delay. <br>Most studies report a mean delay to diagnosis of up to 15 years, with individual <br>cases of &gt;60 years, although a trend over time toward a shorter diagnostic delay <br>has been suggested. While variables associated with this delay have been <br>identified, a lack of symptom recognition resulting in misdiagnosis prior to <br>reaching the narcolepsy diagnosis is the likely underlying reason. This lack of <br>symptom recognition is especially relevant considering the high comorbidity <br>burden that has been shown in patients with narcolepsy as some disorders <br>manifest with symptoms that overlap with narcolepsy. A consequence of delayed <br>diagnosis is delayed treatment, which affects the burden of disease. Substantial <br>detrimental effects on health-care resource utilization, employment, and quality <br>of life have been described after narcolepsy onset and prior to the diagnosis of <br>narcolepsy. This review highlights the importance of closing the diagnostic gap <br>by expanding awareness of narcolepsy and its symptoms.<br><br>Copyright © 2014.

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a widely <br>used scale for daytime sleepiness in adults but contains references to alcohol <br>and driving. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents <br>(ESS-CHAD) has been proposed as the official modified version of the ESS for <br>children and adolescents. This study describes the psychometric analysis of the <br>ESS-CHAD as a measure of daytime sleepiness for adolescents.<br>METHODS: The ESS-CHAD was completed by 297 adolescents, 12-18 years old, from <br>two independent schools in Victoria, Australia. Exploratory factor analysis and <br>Rasch analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the scale.<br>RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis indicated that ESS-CHAD <br>has internal validity and a unidimensional structure with good model fit. Rasch <br>analysis of four subgroups based on gender and year-level were consistent with <br>the overall results. The results were consistent with published ESS results, <br>which strongly indicates that the changes to the scale do not affect the scale's <br>capacity to measure daytime sleepiness.<br>CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the ESS-CHAD is a reliable and internally <br>valid measure of daytime sleepiness in adolescents 12-18 years old. Further <br>studies are needed to establish the internal validity of the ESS-CHAD for <br>children under 12 years, and to establish external validity and accurate cut-off <br>points for children and adolescents.<br><br>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we integrate recent findings from <br>clinical and animal research with the earlier literature. We first review the <br>evidence for net upregulation of the noradrenergic system and its responsivity <br>to stress in individuals with PTSD. Next, we trace the evidence that the α1 <br>noradrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin decreases many of the symptoms of <br>PTSD from initial clinical observations, to case series, to randomized <br>controlled trials. Finally, we review the basic science work that has begun to <br>explain the mechanism for this efficacy, as well as to explore its possible <br>limitations and areas for further advancement. We suggest a view of the <br>noradrenergic system as a central, modifiable link in a network of <br>interconnected stress-response systems, which also includes the amygdala and its <br>modulation by medial prefrontal cortex. Particular attention is paid to the <br>evidence for bidirectional signaling between noradrenaline and <br>corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in coordinating these interconnected <br>systems. The multiple different ways in which the sensitivity and reactivity of <br>the noradrenergic system may be altered in PTSD are highlighted, as is the <br>evidence for possible heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of PTSD between <br>different individuals who appear clinically similar. We conclude by noting the <br>importance moving forward of improved measures of noradrenergic functioning in <br>clinical populations, which will allow better recognition of clinical <br>heterogeneity and further assessment of the functional implications of different <br>aspects of noradrenergic dysregulation.<br><br>Published by Elsevier Inc.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.05.014<br>PMID: 27222130 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

EDS is associated with more advanced disease, <br>higher doses of levodopa-equivalent, and sometimes the use of dopamine agonists. <br>Patients at risk for SA have higher Epworth sleepiness scores (ESS) (although an <br>important subset of patients under-score on this scale) and a more frequent use <br>of ergot or non-ergot dopamine agonists. Polysomnography is a valuable tool in <br>patients with PD, because sleep apnea may occur in 20% of patients, whereas a <br>specific narcolepsy-like phenotype, identified on multiple-sleep latency tests, <br>occurs in patients with most severe EDS; this suggests a lesion in sleep-wake <br>systems. Removal or replacement of a recently introduced dopamine agonist may <br>offer some relief for EDS. If not, the adjunction of modafinil has a good <br>benefit-risk ratio in patients with PD. EDS (and sometimes the narcolepsy-like <br>phenotype) may also affect patients with atypical parkinsonism, such as dementia <br>with Lewy bodies, multiple-system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/j.smrv.2005.01.001<br>PMID: 15893249 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

This study tested this association <br>in daytime workers using injury data taken from organizational archives.<br>DESIGN: A retrospective and prospective study. It covered injury occurrence <br>during two years prior to a sleep disorder assessment/education procedure and <br>injury occurrence in the following year. The workers were given the assessment <br>results and, when applicable, a letter to the treating physician.<br>SETTING: Eight industrial plants. Lectures and discussions on sleep disorders, <br>treatment, and implications to safety and quality of life were conducted with <br>small groups who completed the sleep assessment questionnaire beforehand. The <br>workers completed the sleep assessment questionnaire prior to the <br>lecture/discussion.<br>PARTICIPANTS: 532 non-shift daytime workers.<br>INTERVENTIONS: N/A.<br>MEASURES AND RESULTS: A battery of questionnaires to assess EDS (by the Epworth <br>Sleepiness Scale), suspected sleep disorders, sleep habits, and job and <br>environmental conditions. Of the workers studied 22.6% had EDS. Most of those <br>(96.3%) indicated that they had experienced this propensity for the past two <br>years or more and 56% of them had experienced it for 10 years or more. Logistic <br>regression analysis indicated that during the two-year period prior to the <br>procedure, EDS was associated with an increased risk of sustaining a work injury <br>(OR=2.23, 95% CI 1.30-3.81), even after controlling for possible confounders, <br>including factory category, job and environmental conditions. In the year after <br>the procedure, the injury rate decreased by one-third in the workers with EDS <br>but remained unchanged in the workers without EDS. Consequently, the association <br>between EDS and injury was no longer significant (OR=1.42, 95% CI 0.71-2.85).<br>CONCLUSION: EDS is a prevalent phenomenon in non-shift daytime workers. Workers <br>with EDS had over two-fold higher risk of sustaining an occupational injury. <br>Providing workers with the assessment results and of the implications of EDS for <br>safety may explain the decrease in occupational injuries upon follow-up. This <br>decrease might have occurred either because of workers taking steps to reduce <br>EDS and/or adopting safety behaviors.<br><br>DOI: 10.1093/sleep/25.3.315<br>PMID: 12003162 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

MSL are generally lower following <br>sleep loss, following use of sedating medications, during wakefulness in the <br>late night or early morning hours, and among patients with sleep disorders <br>associated with excessive sleepiness such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep <br>apnea. However, the wide range in MSL makes it difficult to establish a specific <br>threshold value for excessive sleepiness or to discriminate patients with sleep <br>disorders from non-patients. Some of this variation may be attributable to <br>methodological differences and some may be attributable to individual <br>differences in sleep tendency (e.g., related to age). The studies analyzed in <br>this review indicate that the MSL on both the MSLT and MWT does not discriminate <br>well between patients with sleep disorders and normal populations. This is due <br>to large SD as well as floor or ceiling effects in the tests. However, the MSL <br>shows appropriate change from initial testing to subsequent testing following <br>treatment or manipulations intended to alter sleepiness or alertness. <br>Additionally the presence of two or more SOREMPs on the MSLT is a common finding <br>in narcolepsy patients.

The accurate assessment of this <br>tendency is important, but is currently difficult. Several different methods <br>give disparate results. A way out of this dilemma is suggested that involves <br>modification of existing concepts of sleep and wakefulness to conclude the <br>powerful influence of behaviour on sleep propensity. This propensity at a <br>particular time depends, hypothetically, on a mutually inhibitory interaction <br>between a sleep and a wake drive, not on the magnitude of either drive alone. <br>Measurements of sleep propensity are partly situation-specific, whether measured <br>objectively by laboratory tests or subjectively by a questionnaire such as the <br>Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The latter is believed to measure a general <br>characteristic, the average sleep propensity across a range of specified <br>situations in daily life. Any one situational sleep propensity is not always an <br>accurate predictor of another, even in the same subject. The Multiple Sleep <br>Latency test should not be a gold standard for such measurements.

The possibility <br>that this behavior reflects a more pervasive underlying increase in daytime <br>sleepiness has never been systematically examined. Thus, we studied a sample of <br>HD patients on an off-dialysis day to establish the presence or absence of <br>daytime sleepiness independent of effects of treatment, quantify its severity, <br>and identify associated demographic, metabolic, and sleep-related variables.<br>METHODS: Forty-six stable HD patients underwent polysomnography, followed the <br>next day (a nondialysis day) by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT; low score <br>= greater sleepiness), a measure of physiological daytime sleepiness. Subjects <br>also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; high score = greater <br>sleepiness), a measure of subjective daytime sleepiness.<br>RESULTS: One third (n = 15) of subjects had MSLT scores suggesting abnormal <br>levels of physiological daytime sleepiness, and six subjects had scores <br>consistent with severe, pathological sleepiness. Thirty percent (n = 14) had <br>significant subjective daytime sleepiness as measured by the ESS. However, MSLT <br>and ESS scores were unrelated. Higher indices of sleep apnea (r = -0.324; P = <br>0.028) and brief arousals (r = -0.370; P = 0.009) correlated significantly with <br>increased physiological, but not subjective, sleepiness. Longer nocturnal sleep <br>latencies (r = 0.350; P = 0.017) and greater percentage of rapid-eye-movement <br>sleep (r = 0.302; P = 0.042) were associated with decreased physiological <br>sleepiness. Other major demographic, metabolic, and sleep-related variables did <br>not correlate with MSLT scores, and none of the variables examined were related <br>to ESS scores.<br>CONCLUSION: Daytime sleepiness is common in HD patients and may be severe <br>despite the absence of obvious clinical risk factors for the condition. Thus, <br>research designed to identify cost-effective indicators of daytime sleepiness <br>and evaluate the detrimental effects of sleepiness on clinical outcomes in HD <br>patients is warranted.<br><br>Copyright 2003 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.<br><br>DOI: 10.1053/ajkd.2003.50049<br>PMID: 12552502 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

However the relationship between the two is poor, although <br>sleepiness does correlate better with a history of snoring. It has been <br>suggested that sleep can be fragmented by upper airways obstructive events, <br>short of full apnoeas or hypopnoeas, and that these events may not provoke full <br>cortical arousal, but be detectable through activation of the autonomic system. <br>Failure to detect both these could mask a relationship between 'sleep apnoea' <br>and daytime sleepiness. We have therefore measured sleepiness (Epworth <br>Sleepiness Scale) in addition to both autonomic 'arousals' and inspiratory <br>effort (using pulse transit time) in 473 men and women at home. Although <br>sleepiness was related to a history of snoring, it was not significantly <br>predicted by the measures of autonomic 'arousal', or inspiratory effort. <br>Reported snoring and objectively measured snoring correlated poorly. As in other <br>studies, nocturnal hypoxic dips were correlated with obesity, age, alcohol <br>consumption, drug usage and a history of snoring.

To meet this shortcoming, modern models incorporate the <br>arousal component of sleepiness, in addition to the sleep drive. While these <br>models mainly concentrate on short-term changes in sleepiness, "state" <br>sleepiness, there are indications that a stable characteristic level of <br>sleepiness, "trait" sleepiness, is also an important determinant of a person's <br>level of sleepiness. This leads to a conceptualization of sleepiness in which <br>situational factors modify a basal level of sleep drive and arousal. It implies <br>that sleepiness is not a unitary concept and can reflect essentially different <br>states. Multiple sleepiness assessment tools have been proposed in the past. The <br>majority of them offer valuable information, but they do not grasp all aspects <br>of sleepiness. We should bear in mind that tools for assessing sleepiness are <br>always operationalizations reflecting the theoretical framework the investigator <br>has on sleepiness. Hence, rather than searching for a gold standard for the <br>measurement of sleepiness, future research effort should be aimed at linking the <br>various measurement techniques with the hypothesized underlying components of <br>sleepiness on a sound empirical basis.<br><br>DOI: 10.1053/smrv.2002.0191<br>PMID: 12531145 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The objective was to look for <br>clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, and polysomnographic predictors of <br>excessive daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) <br>in obese patients.<br>RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The ESS questionnaire was completed by 1,055 <br>consecutive patients presenting for obesity surgery. Those at high risk for <br>obstructive sleep apnea (n = 331) had diagnostic overnight polysomnography <br>preoperatively. All patients had preoperative clinical, hematologic, and <br>biochemical measurements and completed multiple questionnaires.<br>RESULTS: There was no significant relationship between ESS score and any measure <br>of diagnostic polysomnography factors, including total apnea hypopnea index. <br>Subtle increases in ESS scores were reported in men, older patients, and those <br>with type 2 diabetes. However, general demographic, anthropometric, and <br>biochemical measures of the metabolic syndrome explained only 3% of ESS score <br>variance, and inflammatory markers of C-reactive protein and total white cell <br>count were not predictive. Poor Short Form-36 energy scores (b = -0.18, p &lt; <br>0.001) and high Beck Depression Inventory scores were predictive of higher ESS <br>scores (b = 0.15, p &lt; 0.001) and, along with increasing age and male gender, <br>explained 10% of variance. Symptoms related to disturbed nocturnal sleep <br>explained 30% of variance.<br>CONCLUSION: In severely obese subjects, increased daytime sleepiness does not <br>seem to be driven by obstructive sleep apnea, the degree of obesity, or <br>anthropometric, metabolic, or inflammatory markers of the metabolic syndrome.

They are common complaints in primary <br>care and in specialty medicine. Although they may represent distinct or <br>overlapping phenomena, the general medical literature does not normally <br>distinguish between EDS and fatigue. Despite their prevalence, both EDS and <br>fatigue are identified and treated in a relatively small proportion of those <br>affected. The similarity of EDS and fatigue may create diagnostic ambiguity and <br>thereby contribute to under-identification and under-treatment. Fatigue, in <br>particular, is thought to be difficult to manage when it is identified.<br>METHODS: The literature was searched for reviews, meta-analysis and similar <br>levels of papers focused on EDS or fatigue.<br>RESULTS: EDS and fatigue are operationalized in ways that contribute to blurring <br>rather than to distinguishing between them. Existing measures of both EDS and <br>fatigue may also contribute to their misidentification. Effective treatments for <br>both symptoms have been established. Behavioral interventions are effective and <br>underutilized.<br>DISCUSSION: We suggest more precise operationalization of EDS and fatigue, <br>leading to a refinement of existing measures or development of new tools, a <br>structured interview with fatigue and EDS sections in the clinical setting, and <br>more consideration for behavioral interventions.<br><br>Copyright 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/s0022-3999(02)00542-1<br>PMID: 12505556 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The <br>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is widely used to assess sleepiness. However, EDS <br>assessment with the ESS may not be accurate in older adults. We aimed to (1) <br>describe the responsiveness of nondemented older subjects to the ESS and (2) <br>compare the self-report ESS scores to those of close relatives (CR) proxy and <br>identify factors influencing any discrepancies between them.<br>METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study including 104 <br>independently living nondemented older subjects with daytime sleepiness <br>complaints and 104 nondemented CRs. Cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State <br>Examination) and the ESS were completed separately by subjects and CRs to assess <br>the subject's daytime sleepiness.<br>RESULTS: Almost 60 % of subjects and CRs were not able to answer at least one <br>question on the ESS. Despite the fact that all subjects complained of EDS, only <br>24 % of them had an abnormal ESS score (&gt;10). Subjects rated their sleepiness <br>lower (7.10 ± 4.31) than their CR proxy did (9.70 ± 5.14) (p &lt; 0.0001). In <br>multivariate analysis, an increase in age and a decrease in cognitive status of <br>the subjects appeared related to the difference in ESS between subject and CR.<br>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of older adults were not able to answer all of the ESS <br>items. The ESS may underestimate sleepiness severity in older subjects.

Excessive daytime <br>sleepiness (EDS) is a common-but not universal-accompanying symptom. The purpose <br>of this literature analysis is to understand whether the presence/absence of EDS <br>is associated with different physiopathologic, prognostic, and therapeutic <br>outcomes in OSA patients. Methods: Articles in English published in PubMed, <br>Medline, and EMBASE between January 2000 and June 2017, focusing on no-EDS OSA <br>patients, were critically reviewed. Results: A relevant percentage of OSA <br>patients do not complain of EDS. EDS is a significant and independent predictor <br>of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is associated with all-cause <br>mortality and an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Male gender, <br>younger age, high body mass index, are predictors of EDS. The positive effects <br>of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on blood pressure, <br>insulin resistance, fatal and non-fatal CVD, and endothelial dysfunction risk <br>factors have been demonstrated in EDS-OSA patients, but results are inconsistent <br>in no-EDS patients. The most sustainable cause of EDS is nocturnal hypoxemia and <br>alterations of sleep architecture, including sleep fragmentation. These changes <br>are less evident in no-EDS patients that seem less susceptible to the cortical <br>effects of apneas. Conclusions: There is no consensus if we should consider OSA <br>as a single disease with different phenotypes with or without EDS, or if there <br>are different diseases with different genetic/epigenetic determinants, <br>pathogenic mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment.The small number of studies <br>focused on this issue indicates the need for further research in this area. <br>Clinicians must carefully assess the presence or absence of EDS and decide <br>accordingly the treatment. This approach could improve combination therapy <br>targeted to a patient's specific pathology to enhance both efficacy and <br>long-term adherence to OSA treatment and significantly reduce the social, <br>economic, and health negative impact of OSA.<br><br>DOI: 10.3389/fneur.2018.00505<br>PMCID: PMC6030350<br>PMID: 29997573</p>

Wisconsin Sleep <br>Cohort participants were assessed using polysomnography, the Epworth Sleepiness <br>Scale (ESS) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). SDB was defined as an <br>apnoea/hypopnoea index ≥15 events·h(-1), and sleepiness as ESS ≥10 and MSLT ≤5 <br>min. Odds ratios were calculated using generalised estimating equations <br>associating sleepiness with SDB, and conditional logistic regression examining <br>changes in longitudinal sleepiness status (ESS only). Models were a priori <br>stratified by sex. ESS was measured in 1,281 participants and MSLT in 998 at <br>multiple time-points (ESS n=3,695; MSLT n=1,846). Significant interactions were <br>found between SDB and age in males, but not females. The odds ratios modelled <br>for sleepiness in a 40-yr-old male with SDB were significant compared to a male <br>without SDB (ESS 2.1 and MSLT 2.9); however, these associations were not <br>significant at 60 yrs of age. The within-subject odds ratio for sleepiness was <br>also significant at 40 yrs of age (OR 3.4), but not at 60 yrs of age. The <br>age-related reductions in the association between sleepiness and SDB may have <br>clinical implications for the diagnosis and treatment of SDB in older people as <br>sleepiness is often used as a therapeutic target.<br><br>DOI: 10.1183/09031936.00177411<br>PMCID: PMC3608395<br>PMID: 22241742 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

EDS may lead to cognitive <br>impairment, resulting in inattentiveness, poor memory, mood disorders and an <br>increased risk of accidents. As a result, quality of life is reduced in most <br>patients with EDS as well as in their caregiving spouses. There are a variety of <br>causes leading to EDS, including CNS pathology, neurological dysfunction, <br>associated sleep disorders with insufficient or fragmented sleep, and drug <br>therapy. Since EDS accompanies many neurological disorders, such as <br>neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases, neurologists should be familiar <br>with the diagnosis, its major causes and with treatment options. The main focus <br>of this article is on movement disorders, neuromuscular diseases, multiple <br>sclerosis, dementia, cerebrovascular diseases, head and brain trauma, pain and <br>epilepsy. General management strategies for EDS in all these neurological <br>diseases include sleep hygiene aspects such as extensions of noctural time in <br>bed and frequent naps during the day. Pharmacological treatment is generally <br>achieved with stimulants such as amphetamine, methylphenidate and pemoline, or <br>newer compounds such as modafinil.<br><br>DOI: 10.2165/00003495-200363240-00003<br>PMID: 14664652 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

As such, there has been a push towards designing efficient <br>pharmacological trials (i.e., drug trials), especially with regard to selecting <br>outcomes measures that are both brief and sensitive to changes across the course <br>of the disease, from subtle prodromal changes, to more severe end-stage changes.<br>OBJECTIVES: Recently, to aid in efficient development of new HD research <br>studies, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) <br>published recommendations for measurement selection in HD. While these <br>recommendations are helpful, many of the recommended measures have little <br>published data in HD. As such, we conducted a systematic review of the <br>literature to identify the most common outcomes measures used in HD clinical <br>trials.<br>METHODS: Major medical databases, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the <br>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were used to identify <br>peer-reviewed journal articles in English from 2001 through April 2013; 151 <br>pharmacological trials were identified.<br>RESULTS: The majority of HD clinical trials employed clinician-reported outcomes <br>measures (93%); patient reported outcome measures (11%) and observer reported <br>outcome measures (3%) were used with much less frequency.<br>CONCLUSIONS: We provide a review of the most commonly used measures across these <br>trials, compare these measures to the clinical recommendations made by the NINDS <br>working groups, and provide recommendations for selecting measures for future <br>clinical trials that meet the Food and Drug Administration standards.<br><br>DOI: 10.3233/JHD-140115<br>PMCID: PMC4217648<br>PMID: 25300328 [Indexed for MEDLINE]<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest The authors have no <br>conflict of interest to report.</p>

Participants had their sleep recorded <br>on two consecutive nights and were monitored on the two following days. On the <br>first day, their ability to stay awake and on the second, their sleep propensity <br>were assessed using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the Multiple <br>Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), respectively. Self-report measures were obtained <br>using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale <br>(ESS), and the Toronto Hospital Alertness Test (THAT).<br>RESULTS: Subjective daytime sleepiness (ESS: 9 +/- 5 vs. 6 +/- 4, P=0.053) and <br>objectively measured sleep propensity (MSLT: 10 +/- 5 vs. 17 +/- 3 min, P &lt; <br>0.000) were significantly higher in RP patients than controls, whilst their <br>alertness (THAT: 29 +/- 9 vs. 38 +/- 7, P=0.016) and ability to stay awake (MWT: <br>21 +/- 9 vs. 29 +/- 2 min, P=0.006) were significantly reduced.

Prior to each nap opportunity on MSLT, <br>subjects performed the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) and divided attention <br>driving task (DADT). Results of single versus multiple test administrations were <br>compared using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and adjusted for <br>test administration order effects to explore time of day effects.

Based on binary outcomes, <br>ICC were: MSLT 0.63, PVT number of lapses 0.85, 10-min DADT 0.95, 20-min DADT <br>0.96. Statistically significant time of day effects were seen in both the MSLT <br>and PVT but not the DADT.

One hundred and eighteen consecutive <br>patients with neurologist-diagnosed PD without significant co-morbidities (54% <br>men; mean age, 64 years; mean PD duration, 8.4 years) from four Swedish <br>neurological outpatient clinics participated. The ESS displayed good data <br>quality with few missing items (0-2.5%): good reliability (Cronbach's alpha, <br>0.84), marginal floor and no ceiling effects (1.7% and 0% respectively), and <br>differentiated between those reporting problems staying awake during the past <br>month and those who did not.

This study examined the relationship between daytime sleepiness, SDB, <br>self-report sleep parameters, and mortality in older adults.<br>DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study.<br>SETTING: Clinical and Translational Research Center, at-home testing.<br>PARTICIPANTS: 289 study participants (age &gt;65, no dementia or depression at the <br>time of enrollment) classified as having EDS (n=146) or not (n=143).<br>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Study participants underwent in-lab polysomnography <br>and multiple sleep latency testing at cohort inception. Survival analysis was <br>conducted, with an average follow-up of 13.8 years. Excessive daytime sleepiness <br>was associated with an unadjusted mortality hazard ratio of 1.5 (95% CI <br>1.1-2.0). The unadjusted mortality hazard ratio for study participants with both <br>EDS and SDB (apnea-hypopnea index ≥20 events/h) was 2.7, 95% CI: 1.8-4.2. These <br>findings persisted with an adjusted mortality hazard ratio of 2.3, 95% CI: <br>1.5-3.6 in the final model that included other covariates associated with <br>increased mortality (sleep duration &gt;8.5 h, self-reported angina, male gender, <br>African American race, and age).<br>CONCLUSION: The presence of SDB is an important risk factor for mortality from <br>excessive daytime sleepiness in older adults. In the presence of SDB at an AHI <br>≥20 events/h, EDS was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in <br>older adults, even when adjusting for other significant risk factors, such as <br>prolonged sleep duration. In older patients who had SDB without EDS, or EDS <br>without SDB, there was no increased all-cause mortality rate.<br><br>DOI: 10.1093/sleep/34.4.435<br>PMCID: PMC3065253<br>PMID: 21461321 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Both interventions were delivered by a nurse clinician. The primary <br>outcome was categorically defined treatment response at 4 weeks, based on sleep <br>questionnaires and diaries. Secondary outcomes included self-report symptom and <br>health measures, sleep diaries, actigraphy, and polysomnography.<br>RESULTS: Categorically defined response (67% [n = 26] vs 25% [n = 10]; χ(2) = <br>13.8) (P &lt; .001) and the proportion of participants without insomnia (55% [n = <br>21] vs 13% [n = 5]; χ(2) = 15.5) (P &lt; .001) were significantly higher for BBTI <br>than for IC. The number needed to treat was 2.4 for each outcome. No <br>differential effects were found for subgroups according to hypnotic or <br>antidepressant use, sleep apnea, or recruitment source. The BBTI produced <br>significantly better outcomes in self-reported sleep and health (group × time <br>interaction, F(5,73) = 5.99, P &lt; .001), sleep diary (F(8,70) = 4.32, P &lt; .001), <br>and actigraphy (F(4,74) = 17.72, P &lt; .001), but not polysomnography. <br>Improvements were maintained at 6 months.<br>CONCLUSION: We found that BBTI is a simple, efficacious, and durable <br>intervention for chronic insomnia in older adults that has potential for <br>dissemination across medical settings.<br>TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00177203.<br><br>DOI: 10.1001/archinternmed.2010.535<br>PMCID: PMC3101289<br>PMID: 21263078 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>
