The development and use of a new scale, the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), is 
described. This is a simple, self-administered questionnaire which is shown to 
provide a measurement of the subject's general level of daytime sleepiness. One 
hundred and eighty adults answered the ESS, including 30 normal men and women as 
controls and 150 patients with a range of sleep disorders. They rated the 
chances that they would doze off or fall asleep when in eight different 
situations commonly encountered in daily life. Total ESS scores significantly 
distinguished normal subjects from patients in various diagnostic groups 
including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy and idiopathic 
hypersomnia. ESS scores were significantly correlated with sleep latency 
measured during the multiple sleep latency test and during overnight 
polysomnography. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ESS scores 
were significantly correlated with the respiratory disturbance index and the 
minimum SaO2 recorded overnight. ESS scores of patients who simply snored did 
not differ from controls.

Excessive daytime sleepiness in man: multiple sleep latency measurement in 
narcoleptic and control subjects.

Richardson GS, Carskadon MA, Flagg W, Van den Hoed J, Dement WC, Mitler MM.

Excessive daytime sleepiness is a complaint characterizing many disorders of the 
wakefulness--sleep cycle. This paper addresses the complaint of sleepiness 
objectively by an attempt to differentiate a group of control subjects from a 
group of patients with unambiguous narcolepsy. Fourteen control and 27 
narcoleptic subjects were evaluated by one of three protocols involving 
nocturnal recordings, detailed interviews, and 5 or more 20-min opportunities to 
sleep offered at 2-h intervals beginning at 10.00 o'clock, +/- 30 min. Each 
20-min opportunity to sleep was given to subjects lying in a darkened quiet room 
and asked to try to fall asleep. Polysomnographic variables were monitored and 
sleep was scored in 30-sec epochs by standard criteria. The interval from the 
start of each test to the first epoch of NREM (including stage 1 sleep) or REM 
sleep was called sleep latency. In two of the protocols, the subjects were 
awakened immediately after sleep onset. In the third protocol, the subjects were 
awakened after 10 min of sleep. Narcoleptics consistently fell asleep much more 
readily than did control subjects. We conclude that the Multiple Sleep latency 
test, in addition to providing opportunities to clinically document sleep onset 
REM sleep periods, can demonstrate pathological sleepiness. Based on these data, 
we suggest that an average sleep latency less than 5 min be set as the minimum 
cutoff point for pathological sleepiness.

Disorders of excessive daytime somnolence: polygraphic and clinical data for 100

van den Hoed J, Kraemer H, Guilleminault C, Zarcone VP Jr, Miles LE, Dement WC, 
Mitler MM.

A consecutive series of 100 sleep apnea free patients with the complaint of 
excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) were evaluated; data from medical histories, 
physical examination, personality inventories, and polysomnography [nocturnal 
polysomnography (NPSG) and daytime multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT)] were 
tabulated. Significant differences were found between narcoleptic and 
non-narcoleptic patients in a number of parameters, including EDS severity, mean 
sleep latency on MSLT, sleep latency on NPSG, latency to REM sleep at night, 
number of REM sleep at night, number of REM sleep segments throughout the night, 
the total number of nocturnal myoclonic jerks (as well as the number occurring 
per hour of NREM and REM sleep), and the number of arousals and wake periods 
preceded by a myoclonic jerk. Significant differences in sleep latency during 
MSLT and NPSG testing were found between different EDS diagnostic groups of 
non-narcoleptic patients. The majority of patients in the MSLT group with long 
sleep latencies were in the diagnostic groups of EDS associated with 
psychophysiological and/or psychiatric problems or with drug abuse; patients 
with a diagnosis of idiopathic central nervous system hypersomnia or EDS 
associated with disturbed nocturnal sleep formed the majority of the MSLT group 
with short sleep latencies. The non-narcoleptic patients in a MSLT group with 
short sleep latencies had significantly shorter sleep latencies at night, more 
sleep cycles, higher sleep efficiency, and earlier REM sleep than patients with 
long sleep latencies.

235 cases of excessive daytime sleepiness. Diagnosis and tentative 
classification.

Guilleminault C, Dement WC.

A series of 235 consecutive patients refferred to the Stanford University Sleep 
Disorders Clinic with the complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) were 
investigated extensively. A satisfactory final diagnosis involving a consistent 
syndrome or pathogenic process was made in all but 7 patients. In the course of 
this work a variety of tests, including prolonged polygraphic monitoring of 
multiple variables and CSF measurements before and after probenecid ingestion, 
were utilized. Different syndromes were confirmed (harmonious hypersomnia, 
subwakefulness syndrome); the definitions of others were clarified and extended 
(narcolepsy, drug dependency, periodic hypersomnia associated with menstruation, 
upper airway sleep apnea in children). Two new entities were tentatively 
identified (narcolepsy with sleep apnea, the neutral state syndrome). Narcolepsy 
and upper airway sleep apnea accounted for the majority of the cases (199). A 
strategic schema utilizing specific categories and frequency of occurrence in 
the case series is presented to improve the diagnosis of the complaint of 
excessive daytime sleepiness by the practicing physician. This case series was 
analysed in order to develop tentatively a meaningful nosology.

Maintenance of wakefulness test: a polysomnographic technique for evaluation

Mitler MM, Gujavarty KS, Browman CP.

Ten patients with narcolepsy were given five 20 min opportunities to remain 
awake throughout the day. Trials were offered at 2 h intervals beginning at 
10:00. Polysomnographic variables were monitored during each trial. Sleep 
latency increased when patients were instructed to maintain wakefulness compared 
to when instructed to sleep; however, sleep latencies were still lower for 
narcoleptics than for control subjects. Unexpectedly, we were not always able to 
document patients' reports of increased ability to stay awake. The findings 
suggested that clinical data on symptom control in narcolepsy do not predict 
ability to stay awake. Objective measures of the ability are potentially more 
useful in evaluating treatment.

The present study was part of a larger 3-day, 2-night double-blind parallel 
group design in which 80 young adult men were divided into eight treatment 
groups to examine the effects of benzodiazepines and caffeine on nocturnal sleep 
and daytime sleepiness, performance, and mood. The present study was done to 
examine further the relationship among daytime sleepiness, performance, mood, 
and nocturnal sleep and to determine if and how these relationships were 
affected by the nighttime use of benzodiazepine and the ingestion of caffeine in 
the morning. Subjects received 15 or 30 mg of flurazepam, 0.25 or 0.50 mg of 
triazolam, or placebo at bedtime and 250 mg of caffeine or placebo in the 
morning for two treatment days. Two objective (Multiple Sleep Latency Test and 
lapses) and two subjective (Stanford Sleepiness Scale and Visual Analog Scale) 
measures of sleepiness, five performance tests, and two mood measures (Profile 
of Mood Scale and Visual Analog Scale) were administered repeatedly on both 
days. Electroencephalogram sleep was recorded on both nights. Objective sleep 
measures of daytime sleepiness were not significantly related to either 
performance or mood, but subjects with greater daytime sleepiness had 
significantly longer and more efficient nocturnal sleep. Neither benzodiazepine 
or caffeine influenced these relationships. In contrast, higher estimates of 
subjective sleepiness were significantly associated with poorer mood and tended 
to be related to poorer performance. Caffeine significantly reduced these 
relationships. Nocturnal sleep measures were not related to subjective estimates 
of daytime sleepiness.

The test-retest reliability of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) was 
evaluated in 14 healthy normal subjects. Each slept a single night in the 
laboratory (8 h time in bed) and received the MSLT the following day (1000, 
1200, 1400, and 1600 h) on two occasions separated by 4-14 months. Mean sleep 
latency (four tests) was highly reliable from MSLT to MSLT (r = 0.97, p less 
than 0.001). The test-retest reliability did not change as a function of the 
interval of time between tests or as a function of the level of sleepiness 
(range = 4-20 min) within the population. However, as the number of tests 
comprising the MSLT was reduced below three, the reliability was reduced such 
that only 50% or less of the variance could be predicted.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with considerable health 
risks. Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can mitigate these 
risks, effectiveness can be reduced by inadequate adherence to treatment. We 
evaluated the clinical safety and effectiveness of upper-airway stimulation at 
12 months for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.
METHODS: Using a multicenter, prospective, single-group, cohort design, we 
surgically implanted an upper-airway stimulation device in patients with 
obstructive sleep apnea who had difficulty either accepting or adhering to CPAP 
therapy. The primary outcome measures were the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; the 
number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour, with a score of ≥15 indicating 
moderate-to-severe apnea) and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI; the number of 
times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by ≥4 percentage 
points from baseline). Secondary outcome measures were the Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and the percentage 
of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90%. Consecutive participants 
with a response were included in a randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal 
trial.
RESULTS: The study included 126 participants; 83% were men. The mean age was 
54.5 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the 
square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The median AHI score at 12 months 
decreased 68%, from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour (P<0.001); the 
ODI score decreased 70%, from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour 
(P<0.001). Secondary outcome measures showed a reduction in the effects of sleep 
apnea and improved quality of life. In the randomized phase, the mean AHI score 
did not differ significantly from the 12-month score in the nonrandomized phase 
among the 23 participants in the therapy-maintenance group (8.9 and 7.2 events 
per hour, respectively); the AHI score was significantly higher (indicating more 
severe apnea) among the 23 participants in the therapy-withdrawal group (25.8 
vs. 7.6 events per hour, P<0.001). The ODI results followed a similar pattern. 
The rate of procedure-related serious adverse events was less than 2%.
CONCLUSIONS: In this uncontrolled cohort study, upper-airway stimulation led to 
significant improvements in objective and subjective measurements of the 
severity of obstructive sleep apnea. (Funded by Inspire Medical Systems; STAR

To investigate determinants of daytime sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea 
syndrome (OSAS), we studied 100 unselected OSAS patients by nocturnal 
polygraphic recording and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Data obtained 
were submitted to three types of analysis. Respiratory disturbance index, oxygen 
saturation indices, body mass index, and total nocturnal sleep time did not 
significantly correlate with daytime sleepiness, as measured by the MSLT. 
Analysis of subgroups based on weight and degree of alertness also showed a 
nonsignificant correlation with daytime sleepiness. The best predictor of the 
excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) frequently found in OSAS patients was the 
nocturnal polygraphic recording of the sleep disturbances and sleep structure 
anomalies that reflect the brain's overall dysfunction in OSAS. Understanding 
why an electroencephalogram arousal response occurs during sleep in association 
with abnormal breathing and how this response can become blunted may help us to 
better predict the development of EDS.

Excessive daytime sleepiness, the most prevalent symptom associated with the 
OSAS, is hypothesized to result from either fragmentation of sleep or hypoxemia 
during sleep. Measures of nocturnal sleep, respiration during sleep, and daytime 
sleepiness in 466 patients with apnea were collected to evaluate these two 
hypotheses. The various parameters were submitted to correlation and multiple 
regression analyses to predict daytime sleepiness as measured by the MSLT. The 
RAI, which measures the number of arousals from sleep associated with 
respiratory disturbances (best fragmentation correlation), produced a higher 
correlation with MSLT scores than did TMES (best hypoxemia correlation); 
however, the measures were highly intercorrelated, and multiple regression 
analyses to determine which parameters independently predicted MSLT showed the 
single best predictor to be the RAI. Additional independent variance in MSLT 
score was explained by TST and PSG1. Measures of hypoxemia provided little or no 
independent predictive information. These data support the hypothesis that sleep 
fragmentation is an important determinant of daytime sleepiness in patients with 
apnea.

Despite the subjective reports of patients with difficulty initiating and 
maintaining sleep (DIMS) that they are impaired during the day, consistent 
differences in daytime functions have not been found between normal sleepers and 
patients with insomnia. The present study compares polysomnography and Multiple 
Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) data from 70 clinic patients seeking evaluation for 
chronic insomnia with data from a group of 45 asymptomatic sleepers. The DIMS 
group was found to sleep significantly less than the control group; yet they 
were also significantly more alert than the control group the following day, as 
measured by MSLT. Within the insomnia diagnostic subgroups, a correlation of 
-0.67 (p less than 0.05) was found between nocturnal total sleep time and mean 
MSLT. The results are interpreted as supporting the existence of a tendency 
towards physiological hyperarousal in patients with chronic insomnia. This 
tendency may be exacerbated by other factors (e.g., personality disorder, 
periodic leg movements) also associated with insomnia.

Relationship of autonomic nervous system activity to daytime sleepiness and

Autonomic nervous system (ANS) measures have been used frequently as measures of 
activation or arousal. However, their relationship to standard measures of 
alertness--the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and Stanford Sleepiness Scale 
(SSS)--and to the quantity and quality of prior sleep has not been determined. 
In this study, the direct pupil light reflex (PLR) was measured with the MSLT 
and SSS to determine how ANS activity varies with daytime sleepiness and how all 
three measures were related to prior nocturnal sleep in a group of patients with 
obstructive sleep apnea. When the effects of age and time of day were partialed 
out, PLR data suggest that increased sleepiness as measured by MSLT is 
significantly correlated with increased parasympathetic activity (r = -0.60, p 
less than 0.01) and not with decreased sympathetic activity (r = -0.24, not 
significant). These partial correlations were significantly different (p less 
than 0.05). Increased sleepiness as measured by the SSS was significantly 
correlated with decreased sympathetic activity (r = -0.46, p less than 0.05) and 
not with increased parasympathetic activity (r = -0.00, not significant). These 
partial correlations were significantly different (p less than 0.02). In the 
group of sleep apnea patients, the PLR suggests that increased number of apneas 
and hypopneas (sleep fragmentation) was significantly correlated with both 
decreased sympathetic activity and increased parasympathetic activity. These 
findings suggest that ANS activity is related to daytime sleepiness and to the 
quality of prior sleep.

Twenty-four healthy, young (21-35 years old) men with no complaints of daytime 
sleepiness, no habitual napping, and polysomnographically verified normal 
nocturnal sleep extended their time in bed (TIB) to 10 h for 6 consecutive 
nights to assess the effects of sleep extension on daytime sleepiness and 
performance. Twelve subjects had basal average daily sleep latencies of less 
than or equal to 6 min on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and 12 had latencies 
of greater than or equal to 16 min before TIB was extended. The sleep extension 
improved daytime sleepiness differentially in the two groups. The degree of 
improvement was greater in the sleepy subjects than the alert subjects and the 
pattern of improvement differed between the groups. Sleepy subjects showed an 
immediate and uniform increase in alertness, while alert subjects did not show 
improvements until late in the extension. However, sleepy subjects never 
achieved the baseline level of sleepiness/alertness seen in the alert subjects.

To investigate the prevalence of excessive daytime somnolence and contributing 
factors, 58,162 draftees between 17 and 22 years of age, registered in two 
selection centers of the French army, were screened by means of a 17-item 
questionnaire. In response, 8,201 subjects (14.1%) reported occasional daytime 
sleep episodes, 2,210 (3.8%) one or two daily episodes, and 640 (1.1%) more than 
two daily episodes. Of the total sample, five percent or 2,933 considered these 
sleep episodes to affect their lives. Different possible factors of daytime 
sleep episodes were investigated, including hours of nocturnal sleep, sleep-wake 
schedule, sleep difficulties, use of hypnotics, snoring, and occurrence of 
cataplexy. A strong association was found between these factors and excessive 
daytime somnolence. A stepwise multivariate analysis was performed on five of 
these factors: hours of nocturnal sleep, sleep-wake schedule, sleep 
difficulties, use of hypnotics, and snoring. All five factors were shown to be 
independently related to excessive daytime somnolence and were ranked in the 
following descending order: use of hypnotics, sleep difficulties, irregular 
sleep-wake schedule, snoring, and hours of sleep.

A direct comparison was made between the amplitude of evoked potential (EP) 
component P3 (by the P300 paradigm), a known sensitive EP correlate of 
sleepiness, and sleep latency measures (both to stage 1 or rapid eye movement 
[REM] and to stage 2 or REM) of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) in 11 
untreated narcoleptics and matched controls. Repeated P3 measures were performed 
immediately prior to standard MSLT naps at 10:00 a.m., 12:00 noon, 2:00 p.m., 
4:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Using discriminant analysis and F tests, all three 
measures (P3 and both by MSLT) were found to distinguish the two groups for 
collapsed five-nap data, and all showed essentially parallel circadian 
time-of-day effects, with greatest sleepiness in the midafternoon. The MSLT, 
however, was somewhat more powerful for collapsed data. Both tests misclassified 
some subjects as belonging to the other group, with greater misclassification 
for both tests in the control group and more overall for the P3 measure. Adding 
the two sleep onset REM period (SOREMP) criteria on MSLT for narcolepsy, one 
patient was still classified as normal. Analysis of data from individual naps 
indicated that the MSLT was considerably more powerful in discriminating groups 
than was P3 amplitude, and it did so for all five naps.

""Morning"" and ""evening"" persons, defined according to a modified version of the 
Horne and Ostberg questionnaire, performed the 7/13 min sleep-waking schedule 
under attempting sleep condition after sleeping for one night in the laboratory, 
and under the resisting sleep condition after one night of sleep deprivation. 
Morning types slept significantly more under the attempting sleep condition and 
showed an earlier rise in nocturnal sleepiness. After sleep deprivation, morning 
types had a more distinct sleep propensity pattern with well-defined 
midafternoon and nocturnal sleep gates. In this condition there was a 
significant interaction between type and time of day with respect to amount of 
sleep: morning types slept more during the night, and evening types slept more 
during the day. Based on their amounts of sleep, subjects were also divided into 
""sleepy"" and ""alert"" types, which were independent from the chronotypology.

quality of sleep. Factor analysis of scores from these scales, both for all 
subjects combined and within each of four subjects separately, yielded two 
factors consistently -- 'alertness' and 'tranquillity'. Scores derived from the 
first factor indicated that, in the laboratory setting levels of immediately 
after waking in the morning were reduced, in relation to those before falling 
asleep on the previous night.

Is snoring a cause of vascular disease? An epidemiological review.

Waller PC(1), Bhopal RS.

Author information:

Eight studies that examined the relation between snoring and vascular disease 
were identified. The prevalence of habitual snoring, measured by questionnaire 
or interview, varied from 3% to 29% of adults and was dependent on age, sex, 
obesity, and smoking habit. In men, habitual snoring was associated with 
hypertension and ischaemic heart disease, with adjusted relative risks in the 
range 1.3-2.0. For women, only one study provided adjusted estimates of relative 
risk, which were 2.8 for hypertension and 1.2 for angina. Adequately adjusted 
relative risks for cerebrovascular disease have not been reported, but 
unadjusted estimates varied from 1.6 to 10.3. These studies had several 
limitations, including the lack of a standard definition of snoring, the use of 
unvalidated questionnaires, and failure to account for confounding variables and 
the possibility of reporting bias. Only one study was prospective. 
Epidemiological criteria for a causal association between snoring and vascular 
disease have not been satisfied. The apparent excess risk is probably due to the 
consequences of sleep apnoea rather than snoring itself.

This investigation examines how the sleep propensity (SP) in one test situation, 
such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), is related to sleepiness in 
daily life, as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This is a 
self-administered questionnaire, the item scores from which provide a new method 
for measuring SPs in eight different real-life situations. The ESS item scores 
were analyzed separately in four groups of subjects: 150 adult patients with a 
variety of sleep disorders, 87 medical students who answered the ESS on two 
occasions 5 months apart, 44 patients who also had MSLTs and 50 patients whose 
spouses also answered the ESS about their partner's sleepiness. The ESS item 
scores were shown to be reliable (mean rho = 0.56, p < 0.001). The SP measured 
by the MSLT was related to three of the eight item scores in a multiple 
regression (r = 0.64, p < 0.001). The results of nonparametric ANOVA, Spearman 
correlations, Wilcoxon's t tests, item and factor analysis suggest that 
individual measurements of SP involve three components of variation in addition 
to short-term changes over periods of hours or days: a general characteristic of 
the subject (his average SP), a general characteristic of the situation in which 
SP is measured (its soporific nature) and a third component that is specific for 
both subject and situation. The SP in one test situation, including the MSLT, 
may not be a reliable indicator of a subject's average SP in daily life. Perhaps 
we should reexamine the current concept of daytime sleepiness and its 
measurement.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that, to maintain treatment effects, nasal 
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) needs to be used every night. What remains unknown is the nightly duration 
of use required to normalize functioning. This study, employing probit analyses 
and piecewise regression to estimate dose-response functions, estimated 
likelihoods of return to normal levels of sleepiness and daily functioning 
relative to nightly duration of CPAP.
DESIGN: Multicenter, quasi-experimental study.
SETTING: Seven sleep centers in the United States and Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with severe OSA (total cohort n = 149; the numbers of 
included participants from 85 - 120, depending on outcome analyzed.)
INTERVENTIONS: CPAP.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Before treatment and again after 3 months of therapy, 
participants completed a day of testing that included measures of objective and 
subjective daytime sleepiness and functional status. There were significant 
differences in mean nightly CPAP duration between treatment responders and 
nonresponders across outcomes. Thresholds above which further improvements were 
less likely relative to nightly duration of CPAP were identified for Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale score (4 hours), Multiple Sleep Latency Test (6 hours), and 
Functional Outcomes associated with Sleepiness Questionnaire (7.5 hours). A 
linear dose-response relationship (P < 0.01) between increased use and achieving 
normal levels was shown for objective and subjective daytime sleepiness, but 
only up to 7 hours use for functional status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that a greater percentage of patients will 
achieve normal functioning with longer nightly CPAP durations, but what 
constitutes adequate use varies between different outcomes.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is an important symptom that needs to be 
quantified, but there is confusion over the best way to do this. Three of the 
most commonly used tests: the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), the 
maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) 
give results that are significantly correlated in a statistical sense, but are 
not closely related. The purpose of this investigation was to help clarify this 
problem. Previously published data from several investigations were used to 
calculate the reference range of normal values for each test, defined by the 
mean+/-2 SD or by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. The 'rule of thumb' that many 
people rely on to interpret MSLT results is shown here to be misleading. 
Previously published results from each test were also available for narcoleptic 
patients who were drug-free at the time and who by definition had EDS. This 
enabled the sensitivity and specificity of the three tests to be compared for 
the first time, in their ability to distinguish the EDS of narcolepsy from the 
daytime sleepiness of normal subjects. The receiver operator characteristic 
curves clearly showed that the ESS is the most discriminating test, the MWT is 
next best and the MSLT the least discriminating test of daytime sleepiness. The 
MSLT can no longer be considered the gold standard for such tests.

The daytime sleepiness of a large sample (n = 129) of healthy, young (age 18-29) 
adults with no sleep-wake complaints was measured and compared with that of a 
sample (n = 47) of older (age 30-80) healthy, normal sleeping, subjects. Each 
spent 8 h in the laboratory on 1 night and received the Multiple Sleep Latency 
Test (MSLT) the following day. Sleep latency was measured at 1000, 1200, 1400, 
and 1600 h. Mean sleep latency ranged from 2 to 20 min within each group, but 
the shape of the distribution of latency between groups was different. The mean 
latency of young subjects (particularly college students) was shorter than that 
of the older subjects, with the differences occurring between the sleepiest 80% 
of each distribution. Among the college students, those with higher nocturnal 
sleep efficiencies (the previous night) were sleepier the following day than 
those with lower sleep efficiencies. The relation between nocturnal sleep 
efficiency and daytime sleepiness suggests that the increased sleepiness of 
average young adults is due to mild sleep restriction.

This article focuses on the necessary psychometric properties of a 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) measure. Topics include the importance of 
reliability and validity, psychometric approaches used to provide reliability 
and validity estimates, the kinds of evidence needed to indicate that a PRO has 
a sufficient level of reliability and validity, contexts that may affect 
psychometric properties, methods available to evaluate PRO instruments when the 
context varies, and types of reliability and validity testing that are 
appropriate during different phases of clinical trials. Points discussed include 
the perspective that the psychometric properties of reliability and validity are 
on a continuum in which the more evidence one has, the greater confidence there 
is in the value of the PRO data. Construct validity is the type of validity most 
frequently used with PRO instruments as few ""gold standards"" exist to allow the 
use of criterion validity and content validity by itself only provides beginning 
evidence of validity. Several guidelines are recommended for establishing 
sufficient evidence of reliability and validity. For clinical trials, a minimum 
reliability threshold of 0.70 is recommended. Sample sizes for testing should 
include at least 200 cases and results should be replicated in at least one 
additional sample. At least one full report on the development of the instrument 
and one on the use of the instrument are deemed necessary to evaluate the PRO 
psychometric properties. Psychometric testing ideally occurs before the 
initiation of Phase III trials. When testing does not occur prior to a Phase III 
trial, considerable risk is posed in relation to the ability to substantiate the 
use of the PRO data. Various qualitative (e.g., focus groups, behavioral coding, 
cognitive interviews) and quantitative approaches (e.g., differential item 
functioning testing) are useful in evaluating the reliability and validity of 
PRO instruments.

Vigilance is a term with varied definitions but the most common usage is 
sustained attention or tonic alertness. This usage of vigilance implies both the 
degree of arousal on the sleep-wake axis and the level of cognitive performance. 
There are many interacting neural and neurotransmitter systems that affect 
vigilance. Most studies of vigilance have relied on states where the sleep-wake 
state is altered, e.g. drowsiness, sleep-deprivation, and CNS-active drugs, but 
there are factors ranging from psychophysics to motivation that may impact 
vigilance. While EEG is the most commonly studied physiologic measure of 
vigilance, various measures of eye movement and of autonomic nervous system 
activity have also been used. This review paper discusses the underlying neural 
basis of vigilance and its assessment using physiologic tools. Since, assessment 
of vigilance requires assessment of cognitive function this aspect is also 
discussed.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although there are considerable data demonstrating the impact 
of shift work on sleep and alertness, little research has examined the 
prevalence and consequences of shift work sleep disorder in comparison to the 
difficulties with insomnia and excessive sleepiness experienced by day workers. 
The present study was designed to determine the relative prevalence and negative 
consequences associated with shift work sleep disorder in a representative 
sample drawn from the working population of metropolitan Detroit.
DESIGN: Random-digit dialing techniques were used to assess individuals 
regarding their current work schedules and a variety of sleep- and 
non-sleep-related outcomes.
SETTING: Detroit tricounty population.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2,570 individuals aged 18 to 65 years from a 
representative community-based sample including 360 people working rotating 
shifts, 174 people working nights, and 2036 working days.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Using standardized techniques, individuals were 
assessed for the presence of insomnia and excessive sleepiness, based on DSM-IV 
and ICSD criteria. Those individuals with either insomnia or excessive 
sleepiness and who were currently working rotating or night schedules were 
classified as having shift work sleep disorder. Occupational, behavioral, and 
health-related outcomes were also measured. Individuals who met criteria for 
shift work sleep disorder had significantly higher rates of ulcers (odds ratio = 
4.18, 95% confidence interval = 2.00-8.72), sleepiness-related accidents, 
absenteeism, depression, and missed family and social activities more frequently 
compared to those shift workers who did not meet criteria (P < .05). 
Importantly, in most cases, the morbidity associated with shift work sleep 
disorder was significantly greater than that experienced by day workers with 
identical symptoms.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that individuals with shift work sleep 
disorder are at risk for significant behavioral and health-related morbidity 
associated with their sleep-wake symptomatology. Further, it suggests that the

Effects of total sleep loss on sleep tendency.

Carskadon MA, Dement WC.

Effects of two nights of sleep loss were assessed in six young adult (18--21 
yr.) volunteers (2 women, 4 men). Performance on the Wilkinson Addition Test 
fell significantly below baseline values during the sleep-loss procedure and 
recovered after one or two full nights of sleep. Performance on a Serial 
Alternation Task also declined during sleep loss. Mood and sleepiness, assessed 
by subjective self-rating scales, showed a significantly less positive mood and 
a greater degree of sleepiness during sleep loss, with a recovery to baseline 
levels after one full night of sleep. Sleep tendency, measured at 2-hr. 
intervals during all waking periods, was assessed using an objective measure of 
latency to sleep onset, the Sleep Latency Test. The scores fell to about 1 min. 
at 0600 on the first night of sleep loss and remained at similarly low values 
throughout the sleep loss period. After one night of recovery sleep the scores 
remained significantly below baseline levels, which were not achieved until 
after the second recovery night. The multiple sleep latency test appears to be a 
valuable operationally defined tool for measuring daytime sleepiness.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 
central sleep apnea (CSA), and chronic hypoventilation. This document provides a 
systematic analysis and grading of peer-reviewed, published clinical studies 
pertaining to application of PAP treatment in adults. The paper is divided into 
5 sections, each addressing a series of questions. The first section deals with 
whether efficacy and/or effectiveness have been demonstrated for continuous PAP 
(CPAP) treatment based on a variety of parameters and the level of OSA severity. 
Next, CPAP titration conducted with full, attended polysomnography in a sleep 
laboratory is compared with titration done under various other conditions. The 
third section investigates what can be expected regarding adherence and 
compliance with CPAP treatment as measured by subjective and objective methods 
and what factors may influence these parameters. Side effects and the influence 
of other specific factors on efficacy, effectiveness and safety of CPAP therapy 
are evaluated in the fourth section. Finally, the use of bilevel PAP therapy is 
reviewed for both patients with OSA and those with other selected nocturnal 
breathing disorders. Each section also contains a brief summary and suggestions 
for future research.

Descent into sleep is accompanied by disengagement of the conscious brain from 
the external world. It follows that this process should be associated with 
reduced neural activity in regions of the brain known to mediate interaction 
with the environment. We examined blood oxygen dependent (BOLD) signal 
functional connectivity using conventional seed-based analyses in 3 primary 
sensory and 3 association networks as normal young adults transitioned from 
wakefulness to light sleep while lying immobile in the bore of a magnetic 
resonance imaging scanner. Functional connectivity was maintained in each 
network throughout all examined states of arousal. Indeed, correlations within 
the dorsal attention network modestly but significantly increased during light 
sleep compared to wakefulness. Moreover, our data suggest that neuronally 
mediated BOLD signal variance generally increases in light sleep. These results 
do not support the view that ongoing BOLD fluctuations primarily reflect 
unconstrained cognition. Rather, accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis 
that spontaneous BOLD fluctuations reflect processes that maintain the integrity 
of functional systems in the brain.

Forty narcoleptic patients were given the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, 
consisting of 20 min opportunities to sleep offered at 10.00, 12.00, 14.00, 
16.00 and 18.00 o'clock. Eleven patients had 2 episodes of REM sleep, 5 had 3, 
11 had 4, and 13 had 5 before they were awakened. Fourteen control subjects 
given similar opportunities to sleep (reported in a companion article 
(Richardson et al. 1978)) had no REM sleep episodes. For the 10.00-18.00 o'clock 
opportunities respectively, there were 32, 29, 30, 28 and 27 REM sleep episodes. 
We conclude that this procedure can provide physicians with data useful in the 
diagnosis of narcolepsy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential causes of excessive daytime sleepiness 
in patients with PD-poor sleep quality, abnormal sleep-wakefulness control, and 
treatment with dopaminergic agents.
METHODS: The authors performed night-time polysomnography and daytime multiple 
sleep latency tests in 54 consecutive levodopa-treated patients with PD referred 
for sleepiness, 27 of whom were also receiving dopaminergic agonists.
RESULTS: Sleep latency was 6.3 +/- 0.6 minutes (normal >8 minutes), and the 
Epworth Sleepiness score was 14.3 +/- 4.1 (normal <10). A narcolepsy-like 
phenotype (> or = 2 sleep-onset REM periods) was found in 39% of the patients, 
who were sleepier (4.6 +/- 0.9 minutes) than the other 61% of patients (7.4 +/- 
0.7 minutes). Periodic leg movement syndromes were rare (15%, range 16 to 43/h), 
but obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndromes were frequent (20% of patients 
had an apnea-hypopnea index >15/h; range 15.1 to 50.0). Severity of sleepiness 
was weakly correlated with Epworth Sleepiness score (r = -0.34) and daily dose 
of levodopa (r = 0.30) but not with dopamine-agonist treatment, age, disease 
duration, parkinsonian motor disability, total sleep time, periodic leg 
movement, apnea-hypopnea, or arousal indices.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PD preselected for sleepiness, severity of 
sleepiness was not dependent on nocturnal sleep abnormalities, motor and 
cognitive impairment, or antiparkinsonian treatment. The results suggest that 
sleepiness-sudden onset of sleep-does not result from pharmacotherapy but is 
related to the pathology of PD.

Sleepiness and fatigue are two interrelated, but distinct phenomena; observed in 
a number of psychiatric, medical and primary sleep disorders. Despite their 
different implications in terms of diagnosis and treatment, these two terms are 
often used interchangeably, or merged under the more general lay term of 
'tired'. Sleepiness is multidimensional and has many causes (multidetermined) 
and distinguished from fatigue by a presumed impairment of the normal arousal 
mechanism. Despite its ubiquity, no clear consensus exits as yet as to what 
constitutes sleepiness. Definitions of sleepiness, to date, are at best 
operational definitions, conceptualized so as to produce specific assessment 
instruments. As a result, while a number of subjective and objective measurement 
tools have been developed to measure sleepiness, each only captures a limited 
aspect of an otherwise heterogeneous entity. Fatigue is an equally complex 
phenomenon, its nature captured by a number of conceptualizations and 
definitions. Measures of fatigue have remained subjective, with a 'gold 
standard' for its measurement remaining elusive. Despite a high prevalence and 
high degree of morbidity, fatigue has remained a relatively under appreciated 
symptom, from both a clinical and research point of view.

Daytime sleepiness and sleep habits of Australian workers.

Excessive daytime sleepiness in the general community is a newly recognized 
problem about which there is little standardized information. Our aim was to 
measure the levels of daytime sleepiness and the prevalence of excessive daytime 
sleepiness in a sample of Australian workers and to relate that to their 
self-reported sleep habits at night and to their age, sex, and obesity. 
Sixty-five percent of all 507 employees working during the day for a branch of 
an Australian corporation answered a sleep questionnaire and the Epworth 
sleepiness scale (ESS) anonymously. Normal sleepers, without any evidence of a 
sleep disorder, had ESS scores between 0 and 10, with a mean of 4.6 +/- 2.8 
(standard deviation). They were clearly separated from the ""sleepy"" patients 
suffering from narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia whose ESS scores were in the 
range 12-24, as described previously. ESS scores > 10 were taken to represent 
excessive daytime sleepiness, the prevalence of which was 10.9%. This was not 
related significantly to age (22-59 years), sex, obesity, or the use of hypnotic 
drugs but was related significantly but weakly to sleep-disordered breathing 
(frequency of snoring and apneas), the presence of insomnia, and reduced time 
spent in bed (insufficient sleep).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of driver sleepiness to highway crashes 
and review recent recommendations to change federal hours-of-service regulations 
for commercial motor vehicle drivers.
DATA SOURCES: Information was derived from a search of the MEDLINE, 
Transportation Research Information Service (TRIS), and Bibliographic Electronic 
Databases of Sleep (BEDS) databases from 1975 through 1997 and from manual 
review of the reference lists in relevant journal articles, government 
publications, conference proceedings, and textbooks.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Driver sleepiness is a causative factor in 1% to 3% of all US 
motor vehicle crashes. Surveys of the prevalence of sleepy behavior in drivers 
suggest that sleepiness may be a more common cause of highway crashes than is 
reflected in these estimates. About 96% of sleep-related crashes involve 
passenger vehicle drivers and 3% involve drivers of large trucks. Risk factors 
include youth, shift work, alcohol and other drug use, over-the-counter and 
prescription medications, and sleep disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness of the relationship between sleepiness and 
motor vehicle crashes will promote the health and safety of drivers and highway 
users. Physicians can contribute by encouraging good sleep habits, recognizing 
and treating sleep-related problems, and counseling patients about the risks of 
driving while sleepy. To protect public health and safety, the American Medical 
Association recommends continued research on devices and technologies to detect 
the signs of sleepiness and prevent the deterioration of driver alertness and 
performance. Educational programs about the risks of falling asleep while 
driving are needed for physicians, the public, and commercial truck drivers.

Effects of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty on the daytime sleepiness associated with 
sleep apnea syndrome.

Zorick F, Roehrs T, Conway W, Fujita S, Wittig R, Roth T.

Pre- and post-treatment nocturnal polysomnography and multiple sleep latency 
tests (MSLT) were done in thirty-one patients with obstructive sleep apnea 
syndrome who underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. The treatment reduced by half 
the frequency of apneas and hypoxemia occurring during sleep and improved the 
excessive daytime sleepiness, but not all patients responded similarly. Among 
patients classified as responders, the frequency of apnea was reduced to a level 
seen in healthy adults of the same age, measures of sleep approached normal, and 
excessive sleepiness was eliminated. In nonresponders, frequency of apneas and 
consequent disruption of sleep was not reduced, but hypoxemia was improved. The 
MSLT differentiated responders from nonresponders who showed no MSLT 
improvement, although 70% reported a subjective improvement in excessive 
sleepiness. Measures of the apneas' disruptive effect on sleep and not its 
hypoxemic consequences were most predictive of improvement in excessive 
sleepiness.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a Portuguese-language version of 
the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) for use in Brazil.
METHODS: The steps involved in creating the ESS in Brazilian Portuguese (ESS-BR) 
were as follows: translation; back-translation; comparison (by a committee) 
between the translation and the back-translation; and testing in bilingual 
individuals. The ESS-BR was applied to a group of patients who were submitted to 
overnight polysomnography in order to identify obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea 
syndrome (OSAHS), insomnia and primary snoring. A control group was composed of 
subjects with a history of normal sleep habits, without reported snoring.
RESULTS: A total of 114 patients and 21 controls were included. The 8-item 
scores of the ESS-BR had an overall reliability coefficient of 0.83. The study 
group was composed of 59 patients with OSAHS, 34 patients with primary snoring 
and 21 patients with insomnia. One-way ANOVA demonstrated significant 
differences in ESS-BR scores among the four diagnostic groups (p < 0.001). 
Post-hoc tests between groups showed that the ESS-BR scores of the patients with 
insomnia did not differ from those of the controls (p > 0.05). The ESS-BR scores 
were significantly higher for OSAHS patients and for primary snorers than for 
controls (p < 0.05). In addition, the scores for OSAHS patients were 
significantly higher than were those for primary snorers (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate that the ESS-BR is a 
valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of daytime sleepiness, 
equivalent to its original version when applied to individuals who speak 
Brazilian Portuguese.

Sleep-related disorders are most prevalent in the older adult population. A high 
prevalence of medical and psychosocial comorbidities and the frequent use of 
multiple medications, rather than aging per se, are major reasons for this. A 
major concern, often underappreciated and underaddressed by clinicians, is the 
strong bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and serious medical 
problems in older adults. Hypertension, depression, cardiovascular disease, and 
cerebrovascular disease are examples of diseases that are more likely to develop 
in individuals with sleep disorders. Conversely, individuals with any of these 
diseases are at a higher risk of developing sleep disorders. The goals of this 
article are to help guide clinicians in their general understanding of sleep 
problems in older persons, examine specific sleep disorders that occur in older 
persons, and suggest evidence- and expert-based recommendations for the 
assessment and treatment of sleep disorders in older persons. No such 
recommendations are available to help clinicians in their daily patient care 
practices. The four sections in the beginning of the article are titled, 
Background and Significance, General Review of Sleep, Recommendations 
Development, and General Approach to Detecting Sleep Disorders in an Ambulatory 
Setting. These are followed by overviews of specific sleep disorders: Insomnia, 
Sleep Apnea, Restless Legs Syndrome, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders, 
Parasomnias, Hypersomnias, and Sleep Disorders in Long-Term Care Settings. 
Evidence- and expert- based recommendations, developed by a group of sleep and 
clinical experts, are presented after each sleep disorder.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue and sleep deprivation are important safety issues for 
long-haul truck drivers.
METHODS: We conducted round-the-clock electrophysiologic and performance 
monitoring of four groups of 20 male truck drivers who were carrying 
revenue-producing loads. We compared four driving schedules, two in the United 
States (five 10-hour trips of day driving beginning about the same time each day 
or of night driving beginning about 2 hours earlier each day) and two in Canada 
(four 13-hour trips of late-night-to-morning driving beginning at about the same 
time each evening or of afternoon-to-night driving beginning 1 hour later each 
day).
RESULTS: Drivers averaged 5.18 hours in bed per. day and 4.78 hours of 
electrophysiologically verified sleep per day over the five-day study (range, 
3.83 hours of sleep for those on the steady 13-hour night schedule to 5.38 hours 
of sleep for those on the steady 10-hour day schedule). These values compared 
with a mean (+/-SD) self-reported ideal amount of sleep of 7.1+/-1 hours a day. 
For 35 drivers (44 percent), naps augmented the sleep obtained by an average of 
0.45+/-0.31 hour. No crashes or other vehicle mishaps occurred. Two drivers had 
undiagnosed sleep apnea, as detected by polysomnography. Two other drivers had 
one episode each of stage 1 sleep while driving, as detected by 
electroencephalography. Forty-five drivers (56 percent) had at least 1 
six-minute interval of drowsiness while driving, as judged by analysis of video 
recordings of their faces; 1067 of the 1989 six-minute segments (54 percent) 
showing drowsy drivers involved just eight drivers.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-haul truck drivers in this study obtained less sleep than is 
required for alertness on the job. The greatest vulnerability to sleep or

BACKGROUND: There has been little investigation of fatigue, a common symptom in 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to evaluate fatigue 
more comprehensively, considering relationships with psychological and 
biological factors simultaneously in a population-based IBD community sample.
METHODS: Manitoba IBD Cohort Study participants (n = 318; 51% Crohn's disease 
[CD]) were assessed by survey, interview, and blood sample. Fatigue, sleep 
quality, daytime drowsiness, stress, psychological distress, and quality of life 
were measured with validated scales. Hemoglobin (Hg) and C-reactive protein 
(CRP) levels were also obtained. Differences were tested across disease activity 
and disease subtype.
RESULTS: Elevated CRP was found for 23% of the sample and 12% were anemic; 46% 
had active disease. Overall, 72% of those with active and 30% with inactive 
disease reached clinical thresholds for fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue 
Inventory; P < 0.001); 77% and 49% of those with active or inactive disease, 
respectively, experienced poor sleep (P < 0.001). There were few differences 
between those with CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) on the factors assessed, 
except for higher CRP levels in CD (mean 8.8 versus 5.3, P < 0.02). Multiple 
logistic regression analyses found that elevated fatigue was associated with 
active disease (odds ratio [OR] 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-7.8), poor 
sleep quality (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.9-8.6), and perceived stress (OR 4.2, 95% CI 
2.2-8.1), but not with hours of sleep, Hg, or CRP.
CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and poor sleep are not only highly prevalent in active 
disease, but both are still significant concerns for many with inactive disease. 
Psychological factors are associated with fatigue in IBD in addition to disease 
and sleep considerations.

Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease can be predominant as the 
disease advances, thereby constituting a major source of disease burden for 
patients and caregivers. However, current understanding of NMS is incomplete, 
particularly as a result of the absence of standardisation of outcome 
definitions and the heterogeneity of the risk factors that are assessed. The 
best data on risk factors for NMS in Parkinson's disease come from longitudinal 
studies, with the strongest evidence identifying factors for cognitive 
impairment and dementia, hallucinations, depression, apathy, excessive daytime 
sleepiness, insomnia, and impulse-control disorders. Cognitive impairment, 
hallucinations, and depression have several common risk factors, and many other 
NMS share a few risk factors, showing the interdependence between NMS with 
advancing Parkinson's disease. Disease severity, sex, age, and antiparkinsonian 
medication might have roles in the development of different NMS, although only 
antiparkinsonian medication is potentially modifiable. Until disease-modifying 
therapies are developed, increased knowledge of risk factors could ameliorate 
early identification of patients who are at an increased risk of developing 
specific NMS and potentially allow improvement of symptom management or 
prevention of specific NMS.

INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is common in patients with obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA). However, the effect of OSA on ventricular function, especially diastolic 
function, is not clear. Therefore, we have assessed the prevalence of diastolic 
dysfunction in patients with OSA and the relationship between diastolic 
parameters and severity of OSA.
METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive patients with OSA confirmed by polysomnography 
underwent echocardiography. Diastolic function of the left ventricle was 
determined by transmitral valve pulse-wave Doppler echocardiography. Various 
baseline characteristics, severity of OSA, and echocardiographic parameters were 
compared between patients with and without diastolic dysfunction.
RESULTS: There were 61 male and 7 female patients with a mean age of 48.1 +/- 
11.1 years, body mass index of 28.5 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2), and apnea/hypopnea index 
(AHI) of 44.3 +/- 23.2/h (mean +/- SD). An abnormal relaxation pattern (ARP) in 
diastole was noted in 25 patients (36.8%). Older age (52.7 +/- 8.9 years vs 45.1 
+/- 11.3 years, p = 0.005), hypertension (56% vs 20%, p = 0.002), and a lower 
minimum pulse oximetric saturation (SpO(2)) during sleep (70.5 +/- 17.9% vs 78.8 
+/- 12.9%, respectively; p = 0.049) were more common in patients with ARP. By 
multivariate analysis, minimum SpO(2) < 70% was an independent predictor of ARP 
(odds ratio, 4.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 15.25; p = 0.02) 
irrespective of age and hypertension. Patients with AHI > or = 40/h had 
significantly longer isovolumic relaxation times than those with AHI < 40/h (106 
+/- 19 ms vs 93 +/- 17 ms, respectively; p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Diastolic dysfunction with ARP was common in patients with OSA. More 
severe sleep apnea was associated with a higher degree of left ventricular 
diastolic dysfunction in this study.

A brief self-report scale was developed to assess everyday performance failures 
arising directly or primarily from brief failures of sustained attention 
(attention-related cognitive errors-ARCES). The ARCES was found to be associated 
with a more direct measure of propensity to attention lapses (Mindful Attention 
Awareness Scale--MAAS) and to errors on an existing behavioral measure of 
sustained attention (Sustained Attention to Response Task--SART). Although the 
ARCES and MAAS were highly correlated, structural modelling revealed the ARCES 
was more directly related to SART errors and the MAAS to SART RTs, which have 
been hypothesized to directly reflect the lapses of attention that lead to SART 
errors. Thus, the MAAS and SART RTs appear to directly reflect attention lapses, 
whereas the ARCES and SART errors reflect the mistakes these lapses are thought 
to cause. Boredom proneness was also assessed by the BPS, as a separate 
consequence of a propensity to attention lapses. Although the ARCES was 
significantly associated with the BPS, this association was entirely accounted 
for by the MAAS, suggesting that performance errors and boredom are separate 
consequences of lapses in attention. A tendency to even extraordinarily brief 
attention lapses on the order of milliseconds may have far-reaching consequences 
not only for safe and efficient task performance but also for sustaining the 
motivation to persist in and enjoy these tasks.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Examine whether cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia 
(CBT-I) improves sleep in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as 
nightmares, nonsleep PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and psychosocial 
functioning.
DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH TWO ARMS: CBT-I and monitor-only 
waitlist control.
SETTING: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five adults (31 females: [mean age 37 y (22-59 y)] with PTSD 
meeting research diagnostic criteria for insomnia, randomly assigned to CBT-I (n 
= 29; 22 females) or monitor-only waitlist control (n = 16; nine females).
INTERVENTIONS: Eight-session weekly individual CBT-I delivered by a licensed 
clinical psychologist or a board-certified psychiatrist.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Measures included continuous monitoring of sleep with 
diary and actigraphy; prepolysomnography and postpolysomnography and 
Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS); and pre, mid, and post self-report 
questionnaires, with follow-up of CBT-I participants 6 mo later. CBT-I was 
superior to the waitlist control condition in all sleep diary outcomes and in 
polysomnography-measured total sleep time. Compared to waitlist participants, 
CBT-I participants reported improved subjective sleep (41% full remission versus 
0%), disruptive nocturnal behaviors (based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index-Addendum), and overall work and interpersonal functioning. These effects 
were maintained at 6-mo follow-up. Both CBT-I and waitlist control participants 
reported reductions in PTSD symptoms and CAPS-measured nightmares.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improved sleep in 
individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder, with durable gains at 6 mo. 
Overall psychosocial functioning improved following CBT-I. The initial evidence 
regarding CBT-I and nightmares is promising but further research is needed. 
Results suggest that a comprehensive approach to treatment of posttraumatic 
stress disorder should include behavioral sleep medicine.

CONTEXT: Sleep disorders often remain undiagnosed. Untreated sleep disorders 
among police officers may adversely affect their health and safety and pose a 
risk to the public.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify associations between sleep disorder risk and 
self-reported health, safety, and performance outcomes in police officers.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional and prospective cohort study 
of North American police officers participating in either an online or an 
on-site screening (n=4957) and monthly follow-up surveys (n=3545 officers 
representing 15,735 person-months) between July 2005 and December 2007. A total 
of 3693 officers in the United States and Canada participated in the online 
screening survey, and 1264 officers from a municipal police department and a 
state police department participated in the on-site survey.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comorbid health conditions (cross-sectional); performance 
and safety outcomes (prospective).
RESULTS: Of the 4957 participants, 40.4% screened positive for at least 1 sleep 
disorder, most of whom had not been diagnosed previously. Of the total cohort, 
1666 (33.6%) screened positive for obstructive sleep apnea, 281 (6.5%) for 
moderate to severe insomnia, 269 (5.4%) for shift work disorder (14.5% of those 
who worked the night shift). Of the 4608 participants who completed the 
sleepiness scale, 1312 (28.5%) reported excessive sleepiness. Of the total 
cohort, 1294 (26.1%) reported falling asleep while driving at least 1 time a 
month. Respondents who screened positive for obstructive sleep apnea or any 
sleep disorder had an increased prevalence of reported physical and mental 
health conditions, including diabetes, depression, and cardiovascular disease. 
An analysis of up to 2 years of monthly follow-up surveys showed that those 
respondents who screened positive for a sleep disorder vs those who did not had 
a higher rate of reporting that they had made a serious administrative error 
(17.9% vs 12.7%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.43 [95% CI, 1.23-1.67]); of falling 
asleep while driving (14.4% vs 9.2%; adjusted OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.20-1.90]); of 
making an error or safety violation attributed to fatigue (23.7% vs 15.5%; 
adjusted OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.43-1.85]); and of exhibiting other adverse 
work-related outcomes including uncontrolled anger toward suspects (34.1% vs 
28.5%; adjusted OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.09-1.43]), absenteeism (26.0% vs 20.9%; 
adjusted OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.08-1.40]), and falling asleep during meetings 
(14.1% vs 7.0%; adjusted OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.52-2.52]).
CONCLUSION: Among a group of North American police officers, sleep disorders 
were common and were significantly associated with increased risk of 
self-reported adverse health, performance, and safety outcomes.

Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is widely used to evaluate degree of somnolence 
among Chinese patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Yet no Mandarin-Chinese 
translation has ever reported its validation data. In this study we translated 
and validated the ESS into Mandarin Chinese (CESS). We found, in 31 bilingual 
patients' responses to the CESS and the English ESS obtained 1-2 weeks apart did 
not differ significantly (10.5 +/- 3.7 vs. 9.6 +/- 3.9, p = 0.32, Wilcoxon's 
signed rank test) and were significantly correlated (Spearman's p = 0.67, p = 
0.0004). A total of 359 sleep-disordered breathing subjects were enrolled into 
the validation study in a prospective manner. The CESS showed acceptable 
internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81). Thirty out of these patients 
answered CESS twice at an interval of 2-4 weeks, to yield an acceptable level of 
test-retest reliability (p = 0.74, p = 0.001). The respiratory disturbance 
indices obtained from 251 out of 359 subjects were significantly correlated with 
their CESS scores (p = 0.22, p < 0.001). The standard response mean of CESS was 
0.86 as obtained from 94 out of 359 subjects who had initial control of their 
symptoms at 3 months after radio-frequency palate surgery. We conclude that the 
CESS is reliable in both a linguistic and a test-retest sense, and appears to be 
valid and sensitive to clinical change. The CESS could be used to advantage 
among other Mandarin-speaking subjects as a standardised screening test of 
sleepiness in daily life.

BACKGROUND: Reduced sleep has been reported to predict obesity in children and 
young adults. However, studies based on self-report have been unable to identify 
an association in older populations. In this study, the cross-sectional 
associations between sleep duration measured objectively and measures of weight 
and body composition were assessed in two cohorts of older adults.
METHODS: Wrist actigraphy was performed for a mean (s.d.) of 5.2 (0.9) nights in 
3055 men (age: 67-96 years) participating in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men 
Study (MrOS) and 4.1 (0.8) nights in 3052 women (age: 70-99 years) participating 
in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). A subgroup of 2862 men and 455 
women also underwent polysomnography to measure sleep apnea severity.
RESULTS: Compared to those sleeping an average of 7-8 h per night, and after 
adjusting for multiple risk factors and medical conditions, a sleep duration of 
less than 5 h was associated with a body mass index (BMI) that was on average 
2.5 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-2.9) greater in men and 1.8 
kg/m(2) (95% CI: 1.1-2.4) greater in women. The odds of obesity (BMI >or= 30 
kg/m(2)) was 3.7-fold greater (95% CI: 2.7-5.0) in men and 2.3-fold greater in 
women (95% CI: 1.6-3.1) who slept less than 5 h. Short sleep was also associated 
with central body fat distribution and increased percent body fat. These 
associations persisted after adjusting for sleep apnea, insomnia and daytime 
sleepiness.
CONCLUSIONS: In older men and women, actigraphy-ascertained reduced sleep 
durations are strongly associated with greater adiposity.

OBJECTIVE: The Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is widely used to measure the 
subject's average sleep propensity across those different situations in daily 
life, particularly in patients with sleep-disordered breathing. The purposes of 
this study were to test the hypothesis that the Korean version of the ESS (KESS) 
is valid and evaluate its usefulness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the KESS, which involved translating into 
Korean and then translating back into English to check its accuracy. A total of 
273 participants (181 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-37 mild, 61 moderate, 83 
severe, 32 simple snoring and 60 normal) were included in this study. All 
subjects completed the overnight polysomnograph and 53 of the total subjects 
were randomly selected for a retest with the questionnaire approximately 2∼4 
weeks later. The associations between KESS and the degree of OSA were examined 
through ANCOVA, adjusted for age, sex and BMI.
RESULTS: The total score and each item's score of KESS in patients with OSA were 
significantly higher than subjects with normal controls (p < 0.01). As the 
severity of OSA increased, the KESS showed significantly increasing patterns (p 
for trend <0.01). The KESS in patient groups showed good internal consistency 
(Cronbach's α = 0.90) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.78 to 0.93).
CONCLUSION: The KESS is a reliable and valid tool for screening patients with 
daytime sleepiness in Korea.

Narcolepsy is a central nervous system disorder characterized by excessive 
daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. This placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
randomized, parallel-group, 18-center study assessed the efficacy and safety of 
modafinil, a new wake-promoting drug for treating sleepiness in narcolepsy. 
Subjects with narcolepsy (n = 283) received daily modafinil, 200 or 400 mg, or 
placebo, for 9 weeks, followed by an open-label treatment period. Subjective 
sleepiness was measured with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Objective sleepiness 
was assessed with the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of 
Wakefulness Test. Level of illness was measured with the Clinical Global 
Impression of Change. Modafinil significantly reduced all measures of sleepiness 
and was associated with significant improvements in level of illness. 
Medication-related adverse experiences were few, dose-dependent, and mostly 
rated mild to moderate. Modafinil taken once daily was a very well tolerated and 
effective wake-promoting agent in the treatment of excessive daytime somnolence 
associated with narcolepsy. Modafinil demonstrated an excellent safety profile 
for up to 40 weeks of open-label treatment and efficacy was maintained, 
suggesting that tolerance will not develop with long-term use. Modafinil is a 
pharmacologically and clinically promising compound for the treatment of 
pathological daytime somnolence.

BACKGROUND: Population-based studies suggest that complaints of sleepiness are 
absent in many individuals with sleep-disordered breathing. We investigated the 
prevalence of sleepiness as well as factors associated with sleepiness in 
individuals with moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea 
index > or = 15).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: The Sleep Heart Health Study.
PARTICIPANTS: Sleep Heart Health Study participants (N = 6440).
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleepiness was defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
score >10 or a report of at least frequently feeling unrested or sleepy. 
Forty-six percent of participants with moderate to severe sleep-disordered 
breathing (n = 1149) reported sleepiness. Characteristics associated with 
sleepiness after adjustment for confounders included presence of respiratory 
disease, shorter self-reported weekday and weekend sleep, sleep durations, 
complaints of insufficient sleep, complaints of sleep maintenance insomnia, 
early morning awakening, habitual snoring, and complaints of awakening with leg 
cramps or leg jerks. Some respiratory polysomnography measures were associated 
with sleepiness, but sleep-stage percentages and measures of sleep disruption 
were not.
CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based cohort, subjective sleepiness is absent in 
many individuals with significant sleep-disordered breathing. Comorbid 
conditions, including respiratory disease, sleep restriction, insomnia, and 
nocturnal leg complaints, are important risk factors for sleepiness in 
individuals with moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing.

IMPORTANCE: Many adverse health outcomes are associated with obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA).
OBJECTIVE: To review primary care-relevant evidence on screening adults for OSA, 
test accuracy, and treatment of OSA, to inform the US Preventive Services Task 
Force.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries through 
October 2015, references, and experts, with surveillance of the literature 
through October 5, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs); studies 
evaluating accuracy of screening questionnaires or prediction tools, diagnostic 
accuracy of portable monitors, or association between apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 
and health outcomes among community-based participants.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently reviewed 
abstracts and full-text articles. When multiple similar studies were available, 
random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve 
(AUC), AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, blood pressure, mortality, 
cardiovascular events, motor vehicle crashes, quality of life, and harms.
RESULTS: A total of 110 studies were included (N = 46 188). No RCTs compared 
screening with no screening. In 2 studies (n = 702), the screening accuracy of 
the multivariable apnea prediction score followed by home portable monitor 
testing for detecting severe OSA syndrome (AHI ≥30 and ESS score >10) was AUC 
0.80 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.90), respectively, but 
the studies oversampled high-risk participants and those with OSA and OSA 
syndrome. No studies prospectively evaluated screening tools to report 
calibration or clinical utility for improving health outcomes. Meta-analysis 
found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with sham was 
significantly associated with reduction of AHI (weighted mean difference [WMD], 
-33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 to -25.6]; 13 trials, 543 participants), excessive 
sleepiness assessed by ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.4]; 22 trials, 
2721 participants), diurnal systolic blood pressure (WMD, -2.4 points [95% CI, 
-3.9 to -0.9]; 15 trials, 1190 participants), and diurnal diastolic blood 
pressure (WMD, -1.3 points [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 trials, 1190 
participants). CPAP was associated with modest improvement in sleep-related 
quality of life (Cohen d, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42]; 13 trials, 2325 
participants). Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) and weight loss programs 
were also associated with reduced AHI and excessive sleepiness. Common adverse 
effects of CPAP and MADs included oral or nasal dryness, irritation, and pain, 
among others. In cohort studies, there was a consistent association between AHI 
and all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical 
utility of all potential screening tools. Multiple treatments for OSA reduce 
AHI, ESS scores, and blood pressure. Trials of CPAP and other treatments have 
not established whether treatment reduces mortality or improves most other 
health outcomes, except for modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life.

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered eight-item 
questionnaire that is widely used in English speaking countries for assessment 
of daytime sleepiness in adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
reliability and validity of the ESS in the Turkish language. The Turkish version 
of the ESS (ESStr) was applied to 194 healthy controls and 150 consecutive 
subjects attending the sleep centre with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. 
Test-retest reliability of the ESStr was tested in a separate group of 30 
subjects. The ESStr scores of 60 subjects with mild to severe obstructive sleep 
apnoea (OSA) were compared with the ESStr scores of 60 healthy controls matched 
for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). Concurrent validity with the 
Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQtr) was also assessed in 12 
subjects. The questionnaire had a high level of internal consistency as measured 
by Cronbach's alpha (> or =0.86). The test-retest intraclass correlation 
coefficient was r = 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.64-0.90) (p < 0.001) and 
Spearman's correlation coefficient was r = 0.80 (p = 0.01). The control group 
had lower ESStr scores than subjects with sleep-disordered breathing (3.6 +/- 3 
vs 12.6 +/- 6, respectively; p < 0.001). Subjects with mild sleep-disordered 
breathing also had lower scores of the ESStr than those with moderate and severe 
sleep-disordered breathing (10 +/- 6.2 vs 14 +/- 5. and 10 +/- 6.2 vs 16 +/- 
5.4, respectively; both p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences 
between moderate and severe subjects with sleep apnoea. There were significant 
correlations between the ESStr and total FOSQtr and its subscales (r = -0.22 to 
r = -0.92; all p = 0.05). Factor analysis of item scores showed that the ESStr 
had only one factor. The ESStr is a reliable and valid measure of daytime 
sleepiness. These features and the simplicity of the ESStr make it a valuable 
measure for clinical management and research.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To develop a short and practical scale (SCOPA-SLEEP) that 
evaluates nighttime sleep and daytime sleepiness. The scale is developed for 
research in Parkinson disease but may be of value for other somatic diseases.
DESIGN: Postal survey including 4 instruments, the SCOPA-SLEEP nighttime sleep 
(5 items) and daytime sleepiness (6 items), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 
and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
SETTING: Movement Disorders Center, Department of Neurology, Leiden University 
Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: 143 patients with Parkinson disease and 104 controls.
INTERVENTIONS: N/A.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Reliability of the scale was high: internal 
consistency of the nighttime sleep and daytime sleepiness scales were 0.88 and 
0.91, respectively (Cronbach alpha), and test-retest reliabilities were 0.94 and 
0.89, respectively (intraclass correlation coefficient). Scale scores differed 
significantly between patients and controls (P < .001). Construct validity was 
assessed by correlations with scales that addressed similar constructs. 
Correlation between the nighttime sleep scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index was 0.83 (P < .001), and the correlation between the daytime sleepiness 
scale and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 0.81 (P < .001). Factor analysis 
revealed 1 factor each for both scales, indicating that the scales measure 1 
construct, which justifies the calculation of sumscores. The coefficient of 
variation of both the nighttime sleep and the daytime sleepiness scale was 
higher than that of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale, indicating a better ability to detect differences between 
individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: The SCOPA-SLEEP is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing 
nighttime sleep and daytime sleepiness in patients with Parkinson disease.

How much sleep do we need?

There is increasing concern for sleeplessness-related risks in modern society. 
Some recent epidemiological data seem to support the view that many segments of 
the adult population have chronically inadequate sleep. On the other hand, some 
experts have claimed that our core, basic amount of sleep is around 6 h per 
night, and that the rest of our sleep can be easily curtailed, being unnecessary 
to fulfill any sleep need. However, experimental data on the effects of both 
acute and cumulative partial sleep deprivation (PSD) consistently point out that 
sleep restriction has substantial negative effects on sleepiness, motor and 
cognitive performance and mood, as well as on some metabolic, hormonal and 
immunological variables. As chronic PSD may have serious long-term adverse 
health effects, it should be avoided in the general population. In the 
short-term, the effects of sleep curtailment seem to accumulate linearly, while 
the effects of long-term PSD should be further investigated, as the few 
available studies are flawed by methodological weaknesses. On the other hand, 
there is evidence that extending sleep by 2-3 h beyond the norm produces only 
marginal benefits for an average individual. Finally, it is underlined that, as 
large individual differences do exist in the need for sleep, the search for the 
sleep need may be vain. A somnotypology, taking into account age, gender and the 
position in both the sleep-alert and the morningness-eveningness continuum, 
should help in the search for the actual individual sleep need. 2001 Harcourt

Our goal was to validate a self-administered narcolepsy questionnaire focusing 
on cataplexy. Nine hundred and eight three consecutive subjects entering the 
Stanford Sleep Disorder Clinic completed the questionnaire. Clinic physicians 
reported on the presence or absence of ""clear-cut"" cataplexy. Responses to 51 
cataplexy-related questionnaire items were compared between subjects with 
clear-cut cataplexy (n = 63) and all other patients (n = 920). As previously 
reported, a large portion of the non-narcoleptic population was found to 
experience muscle weakness with various intense emotions (1.8% to 18.0%) or 
athletic activities (26.2% to 28.8%). Factor analysis and Receiver Operating 
Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis were used to determine the most predictive 
items for clear-cut cataplexy. Most strikingly, cataplexy was best 
differentiated from other types of muscle weakness when triggered by only three 
typical situations: ""when hearing and telling a joke,"" ""while laughing,"" or 
""when angry."" Face or neck, rather than limbs, were also more specifically 
involved in clear-cut cataplexy. Other items, such as length of attacks, 
bilaterality, and alteration in consciousness, were poorly predictive. A simple 
decision tree was constructed to isolate high-(91.7%) and low-(0.6%) risk groups 
for cataplexy. This questionnaire will be used to increase diagnostic 
consistency across clinical centers, thus providing more homogenous subject 
pools for clinical and basic research studies.

BACKGROUND: Various Japanese versions of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) have 
been used, but none was developed via standard procedures. Here we report on the 
construction and testing of the developer-authorized Japanese version of the ESS 
(JESS).
METHODS: Developing the JESS involved translations, back translations, a pilot 
study, and psychometric testing. We identified questions in the ESS that were 
difficult to answer or were inappropriate in Japan, proposed possible 
replacements for those questions, and tested them with analyses based on item 
response theory (IRT) and classical test theory. The subjects were healthy 
people and patients with narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, or obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome.
RESULTS: We identified two of our proposed questions as appropriate replacements 
for two problematic questions in the ESS. The JESS had very few missing data. 
Internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability were high. The 
patients had significantly higher JESS scores than did the healthy people, and 
higher JESS scores were associated with worse daytime function, as measured with 
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, the JESS provides reliable and valid information on 
daytime sleepiness. Researchers who use the ESS with other populations should 
combine their knowledge of local conditions with the results of psychometric 
tests.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if a treatment for interepisode bipolar disorder I 
patients with insomnia improves mood state, sleep, and functioning.
METHOD: Alongside psychiatric care, interepisode bipolar disorder I participants 
with insomnia were randomly allocated to a bipolar disorder-specific 
modification of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTI-BP; n = 30) or 
psychoeducation (PE; n = 28) as a comparison condition. Outcomes were assessed 
at baseline, the end of 8 sessions of treatment, and 6 months later. This pilot 
was conducted to determine initial feasibility and generate effect size 
estimates.
RESULTS: During the 6-month follow-up, the CBTI-BP group had fewer days in a 
bipolar episode relative to the PE group (3.3 days vs. 25.5 days). The CBTI-BP 
group also experienced a significantly lower hypomania/mania relapse rate (4.6% 
vs. 31.6%) and a marginally lower overall mood episode relapse rate (13.6% vs. 
42.1%) compared with the PE group. Relative to PE, CBTI-BP reduced insomnia 
severity and led to higher rates of insomnia remission at posttreatment and 
marginally higher rates at 6 months. Both CBTI-BP and PE showed statistically 
significant improvement on selected sleep and functional impairment measures. 
The effects of treatment were well sustained through follow-up for most 
outcomes, although some decline on secondary sleep benefits was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: CBTI-BP was associated with reduced risk of mood episode relapse 
and improved sleep and functioning on certain outcomes in bipolar disorder. 
Hence, sleep disturbance appears to be an important pathway contributing to 
bipolar disorder. The need to develop bipolar disorder-specific sleep diary 
scoring standards is highlighted.

A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial comparing the 
effects of three doses of orally administered sodium oxybate with placebo for 
the treatment of narcolepsy.

[No authors listed]

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of three doses 
of sodium oxybate and placebo for the treatment of narcolepsy symptoms.
DESIGN: A multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.
SETTING: N/A.
PARTICIPANTS: Study subjects were 136 narcolepsy patients with 3 to 249 (median 
21) cataplexy attacks weekly.
INTERVENTIONS: Prior to baseline measures, subjects discontinued anticataplectic 
medications. Stable doses of stimulants were permitted. Subjects were randomized 
in blinded fashion to receive 3, 6, or 9 g doses of sodium oxybate or placebo 
taken in equally divided doses upon retiring to bed and 2.5-4 hours later for 4 
weeks.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Disease symptoms and adverse events were recorded in 
daily diaries. The primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline in 
weekly cataplexy attacks. Secondary measures included daytime sleepiness using 
the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), inadvertent daytime naps/sleep attacks and 
nighttime awakenings. Investigators assessed changes in disease severity using 
Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-c). Compared to placebo, weekly 
cataplexy attacks were decreased by sodium oxybate at the 6 g dose (p=0.0529) 
and significantly at the 9 g dose (p=0.0008). The ESS was reduced at all doses, 
becoming significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0001). The CGI-c demonstrated a 
dose-related improvement, significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0002). The frequency 
of inadvertent naps/sleep attacks and the nighttime awakenings showed similar 
dose-response trends, becoming significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0122 and 
p=0.0035, respectively). Sodium oxybate was generally well-tolerated at all 
three doses. Nausea, headache, dizziness and enuresis were the most commonly 
reported adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Sodium oxybate significantly improved symptoms in patients with 
narcolepsy and was well tolerated.

The maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) is a daytime polysomnographic 
procedure which quantifies wake tendency by measuring the ability to remain 
awake during soporific circumstances. We present normative data based on 64 
healthy subjects (27 males and 37 females) who adhered to uniform MWT procedural 
conditions including polysomnographic montage, illuminance level, seating 
position, room temperature, meal timing, and subject instructions. When allowed 
a maximum trial duration of 40 min, subjects' mean sleep latency to the first 
epoch of sustained sleep was 35.2 +/- 7.9 min. The lower normal limit, defined 
as two standard deviations below the mean, was 19.4 min. Calculation of data on 
the basis of a maximum trial duration of 20 min and sleep latency to the first 
appearance of brief sleep (a microsleep episode or one epoch of any stage of 
sleep) yielded a mean sleep latency of 18.1 +/- 3.6 min and a lower normal limit 
of 10.9 min. Sleep latency scores were significantly higher than those 
previously reported in patients with disorders of excessive somnolence. 
Therefore, the MWT appears to be a useful procedure in differentiating groups 
with normal daytime wake tendency from those with impaired wake tendency and in 
identifying individuals with pathologic inability to remain awake under 
soporific circumstances.

Patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome can experience residual 
daytime sleepiness despite regular use of nasal continuous positive airway 
pressure therapy. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group study assessed the efficacy and safety of modafinil for the treatment of 
residual daytime sleepiness in such patients. Patients received modafinil (n = 
77) (200 mg/d, Week 1; 400 mg/d, Weeks 2 to 4) or matching placebo (n = 80) once 
daily for 4 wk. Modafinil significantly improved daytime sleepiness, with 
significantly greater mean changes from baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
scores at Weeks 1 and 4 (p < 0.001) and in multiple sleep latency times (MSLT) 
at Week 4 (p < 0.05). The percentage of patients with normalized daytime 
sleepiness (Epworth score < 10) was significantly higher with modafinil (51%) 
than with placebo (27%) (p < 0.01), but not for MSLT (> 10 min; 29% versus 25%). 
Headache (modafinil, 23%; placebo, 11%; p = 0.044) and nervousness (modafinil, 
12%; placebo, 3%; p = 0.024) were the most common adverse events. During 
modafinil or placebo treatment, the mean duration of nCPAP use was 6.2 h/night, 
with no significant change from baseline observed between groups. Modafinil may 
be a useful adjunct treatment for the management of residual daytime sleepiness 
in patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome who are regular users 
of nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy.

There is a broad spectrum of sleep disturbances observed in Parkinson's disease 
(PD). A variety of scales have been applied to the evaluation of PD sleep and 
wakefulness, but only a small number have been assessed specifically for 
clinimetric properties in the PD population. The movement disorder society has 
commissioned this task force to examine these scales and to assess their use in 
PD. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the use of sleep 
scales in PD and to determine which scales qualified for a detailed critique. 
The task force members, all of whom have extensive experience in assessing sleep 
in PD reviewed each of the scales using a structured proforma. Scales were 
categorized into recommended, suggested and listed according to predefined 
criteria. A total of 48 potential scales were identified from the search and 
reviewed. Twenty-nine were excluded because they did not meet review criteria or 
were variations of scales already included, leaving 19 scales that were 
critiqued and rated by the task force based on the rating criteria. Only six 
were found to meet criteria for recommendation or suggestion by the task force: 
the PD sleep scale (PDSS) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) are 
recommended for rating overall sleep problems to screen and to measure severity, 
the SCOPA-sleep (SCOPA) is recommended for rating overall sleep problems both to 
screen and to measure severity, and for rating daytime sleepiness; the Epworth 
sleepiness scale (ESS) is recommended for rating daytime sleepiness to screen 
and to measure severity; the inappropriate sleep composite score (ISCS) is 
suggested for rating severe daytime sleepiness or sleep attacks to screen and to 
measure severity; and the Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS) is suggested for 
rating sleepiness and to measure severity at a specific moment. The task force 
does not recommend the development of new scales, but emphasizes the need for 
educational efforts to train physicians in sleep interview techniques and 
polysomnography.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome 
(OSAHS) have long been considered predominantly male-related conditions. The 
clinical presentation of sleep disordered breathing in females differs from 
males and can vary with age and physiological status, e.g. menopause and 
pregnancy. Overall, females appear to be more symptomatic, with lower 
apnoea-hypopnoea index scores compared to males. Furthermore, they appear to 
have more prolonged partial upper airway obstruction, and may report insomnia as 
a symptom of OSAHS more frequently. As a consequence of these differences in 
clinical presentation, females with sleep disordered breathing are often 
underdiagnosed and undertreated compared to males. This review is aimed at 
discussing the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology and hormonal 
and metabolic differences in females who present with OSA/OSAHS in comparison to 
males.

Narcolepsy, a chronic neurologic condition resulting from dysregulation of the 
sleep-wake cycle, usually has an onset at an early age. However, a long delay 
until diagnosis has been consistently reported in the literature across 
countries and several publications have focused on characterizing this delay. 
Most studies report a mean delay to diagnosis of up to 15 years, with individual 
cases of >60 years, although a trend over time toward a shorter diagnostic delay 
has been suggested. While variables associated with this delay have been 
identified, a lack of symptom recognition resulting in misdiagnosis prior to 
reaching the narcolepsy diagnosis is the likely underlying reason. This lack of 
symptom recognition is especially relevant considering the high comorbidity 
burden that has been shown in patients with narcolepsy as some disorders 
manifest with symptoms that overlap with narcolepsy. A consequence of delayed 
diagnosis is delayed treatment, which affects the burden of disease. Substantial 
detrimental effects on health-care resource utilization, employment, and quality 
of life have been described after narcolepsy onset and prior to the diagnosis of 
narcolepsy. This review highlights the importance of closing the diagnostic gap 
by expanding awareness of narcolepsy and its symptoms.

RATIONALE: Twenty-eight percent of people with mild to moderate obstructive 
sleep apnea experience daytime sleepiness, which interferes with daily 
functioning. It remains unclear whether treatment with continuous positive 
airway pressure improves daytime function in these patients.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure 
treatment to improve functional status in sleepy patients with mild and moderate 
obstructive sleep apnea.
METHODS: Patients with self-reported daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale score >10) and an apnea-hypopnea index with 3% desaturation and from 5 to 
30 events per hour were randomized to 8 weeks of active or sham continuous 
positive airway pressure treatment. After the 8-week intervention, participants 
in the sham arm received 8 weeks of active continuous positive airway pressure 
treatment.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Total score on the Functional Outcomes of 
Sleep Questionnaire was the primary outcome measure. The adjusted mean change in 
the Total score after the first 8-week intervention was 0.89 for the active 
group (n = 113) and -0.06 for the placebo group (n = 110) (P = 0.006). The group 
difference in mean change corresponded to an effect size of 0.41 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.14-0.67). The mean (SD) improvement in Functional Outcomes of Sleep 
Questionnaire Total score from the beginning to the end of the crossover phase 
(n = 91) was 1.73 ± 2.50 (t[90] = 6.59; P < 0.00001) with an effect size of 
0.69.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous positive airway pressure treatment improves the 
functional outcome of sleepy patients with mild and moderate obstructive sleep 
apnea.

OBJECTIVE: A validated measure of daytime sleepiness for adolescents is needed 
to better explore emerging relationships between sleepiness and the mental and 
physical health of adolescents. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a widely 
used scale for daytime sleepiness in adults but contains references to alcohol 
and driving. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents 
(ESS-CHAD) has been proposed as the official modified version of the ESS for 
children and adolescents. This study describes the psychometric analysis of the 
ESS-CHAD as a measure of daytime sleepiness for adolescents.
METHODS: The ESS-CHAD was completed by 297 adolescents, 12-18 years old, from 
two independent schools in Victoria, Australia. Exploratory factor analysis and 
Rasch analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the scale.
RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis indicated that ESS-CHAD 
has internal validity and a unidimensional structure with good model fit. Rasch 
analysis of four subgroups based on gender and year-level were consistent with 
the overall results. The results were consistent with published ESS results, 
which strongly indicates that the changes to the scale do not affect the scale's 
capacity to measure daytime sleepiness.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the ESS-CHAD is a reliable and internally 
valid measure of daytime sleepiness in adolescents 12-18 years old. Further 
studies are needed to establish the internal validity of the ESS-CHAD for 
children under 12 years, and to establish external validity and accurate cut-off 
points for children and adolescents.

A central role for noradrenergic dysregulation in the pathophysiology of 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is increasingly suggested by both clinical 
and basic neuroscience research. Here, we integrate recent findings from 
clinical and animal research with the earlier literature. We first review the 
evidence for net upregulation of the noradrenergic system and its responsivity 
to stress in individuals with PTSD. Next, we trace the evidence that the α1 
noradrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin decreases many of the symptoms of 
PTSD from initial clinical observations, to case series, to randomized 
controlled trials. Finally, we review the basic science work that has begun to 
explain the mechanism for this efficacy, as well as to explore its possible 
limitations and areas for further advancement. We suggest a view of the 
noradrenergic system as a central, modifiable link in a network of 
interconnected stress-response systems, which also includes the amygdala and its 
modulation by medial prefrontal cortex. Particular attention is paid to the 
evidence for bidirectional signaling between noradrenaline and 
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in coordinating these interconnected 
systems. The multiple different ways in which the sensitivity and reactivity of 
the noradrenergic system may be altered in PTSD are highlighted, as is the 
evidence for possible heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of PTSD between 
different individuals who appear clinically similar. We conclude by noting the 
importance moving forward of improved measures of noradrenergic functioning in 
clinical populations, which will allow better recognition of clinical 
heterogeneity and further assessment of the functional implications of different 
aspects of noradrenergic dysregulation.

Excessive daytime sleepiness in parkinsonism.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) can affect 20-50% of patients with 
Parkinson's disease (PD), whereas sleep attacks (SA), which are sleep episodes 
without prodroma, seem infrequent. EDS is associated with more advanced disease, 
higher doses of levodopa-equivalent, and sometimes the use of dopamine agonists. 
Patients at risk for SA have higher Epworth sleepiness scores (ESS) (although an 
important subset of patients under-score on this scale) and a more frequent use 
of ergot or non-ergot dopamine agonists. Polysomnography is a valuable tool in 
patients with PD, because sleep apnea may occur in 20% of patients, whereas a 
specific narcolepsy-like phenotype, identified on multiple-sleep latency tests, 
occurs in patients with most severe EDS; this suggests a lesion in sleep-wake 
systems. Removal or replacement of a recently introduced dopamine agonist may 
offer some relief for EDS. If not, the adjunction of modafinil has a good 
benefit-risk ratio in patients with PD. EDS (and sometimes the narcolepsy-like 
phenotype) may also affect patients with atypical parkinsonism, such as dementia 
with Lewy bodies, multiple-system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Only a few studies have examined the possible association 
between excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and risk of occupational injuries, 
and most of them were based on self-reports. This study tested this association 
in daytime workers using injury data taken from organizational archives.
DESIGN: A retrospective and prospective study. It covered injury occurrence 
during two years prior to a sleep disorder assessment/education procedure and 
injury occurrence in the following year. The workers were given the assessment 
results and, when applicable, a letter to the treating physician.
SETTING: Eight industrial plants. Lectures and discussions on sleep disorders, 
treatment, and implications to safety and quality of life were conducted with 
small groups who completed the sleep assessment questionnaire beforehand. The 
workers completed the sleep assessment questionnaire prior to the 
lecture/discussion.
PARTICIPANTS: 532 non-shift daytime workers.
INTERVENTIONS: N/A.
MEASURES AND RESULTS: A battery of questionnaires to assess EDS (by the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale), suspected sleep disorders, sleep habits, and job and 
environmental conditions. Of the workers studied 22.6% had EDS. Most of those 
(96.3%) indicated that they had experienced this propensity for the past two 
years or more and 56% of them had experienced it for 10 years or more. Logistic 
regression analysis indicated that during the two-year period prior to the 
procedure, EDS was associated with an increased risk of sustaining a work injury 
(OR=2.23, 95% CI 1.30-3.81), even after controlling for possible confounders, 
including factory category, job and environmental conditions. In the year after 
the procedure, the injury rate decreased by one-third in the workers with EDS 
but remained unchanged in the workers without EDS. Consequently, the association 
between EDS and injury was no longer significant (OR=1.42, 95% CI 0.71-2.85).
CONCLUSION: EDS is a prevalent phenomenon in non-shift daytime workers. Workers 
with EDS had over two-fold higher risk of sustaining an occupational injury. 
Providing workers with the assessment results and of the implications of EDS for 
safety may explain the decrease in occupational injuries upon follow-up. This 
decrease might have occurred either because of workers taking steps to reduce 
EDS and/or adopting safety behaviors.

The studies examined in this review indicate that the MSL is sensitive to 
conditions expected to increase sleepiness. MSL are generally lower following 
sleep loss, following use of sedating medications, during wakefulness in the 
late night or early morning hours, and among patients with sleep disorders 
associated with excessive sleepiness such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep 
apnea. However, the wide range in MSL makes it difficult to establish a specific 
threshold value for excessive sleepiness or to discriminate patients with sleep 
disorders from non-patients. Some of this variation may be attributable to 
methodological differences and some may be attributable to individual 
differences in sleep tendency (e.g., related to age). The studies analyzed in 
this review indicate that the MSL on both the MSLT and MWT does not discriminate 
well between patients with sleep disorders and normal populations. This is due 
to large SD as well as floor or ceiling effects in the tests. However, the MSL 
shows appropriate change from initial testing to subsequent testing following 
treatment or manipulations intended to alter sleepiness or alertness. 
Additionally the presence of two or more SOREMPs on the MSLT is a common finding 
in narcolepsy patients. However, SOREMPs are not exclusive to narcolepsy 
patients but are frequent in untreated sleep apnea

OBJECTIVES: To assess the therapeutic efficacy of modafinil in the treatment of 
increased daytime sleepiness in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study with two 
2-week treatment blocks, separated by a 2-week washout phase.
SETTING: Tertiary Parkinson's disease care center and sleep laboratory at 
university hospital neurology department.
PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with idiopathic PD and daytime sleepiness (Epworth 
sleepiness score (ESS) 10 or more).
INTERVENTIONS: Administration of placebo or modafinil as a single morning dose 
in a randomized crossover order. The modafinil dose was 100 mg in the first, and 
200 mg in the second treatment week.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At baseline and at the end of each treatment block, 
sleepiness was evaluated using subjective (perceived sleepiness with the ESS) 
and objective measures (maintenance of wakefulness test). Twelve patients 
completed the study (9 male, 3 female; mean age 65.0 +/- 7.6 years, mean disease 
duration 6.8 +/- 4.1 years). Epworth scores were significantly improved with 
modafinil (3.42 +/- 3.90) compared to placebo (0.83 +/- 1.99; p = 0.011). 
Latency to sleep in the maintenance of wakefulness test was not significantly 
altered by modafinil treatment: 10.9 (3-40)/15.1 (2.5-40) minutes before/after 
placebo and 12 (2.6-40)/17.8 (4.2-40) minutes before/after modafinil (p = 0.139) 
[data given as mean +/- standard deviation or median (range)].
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that modafinil improves daytime 
sleepiness in PD patients, at least on a subjective or behavioral level. 
Modafinil treatment may be considered for EDS in PD patients, in whom otherwise 
treatable causes of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) are absent.

The consequences of dozing off when intending to stay awake, e.g. while driving 
or at work, are potentially catastrophic. The accurate assessment of this 
tendency is important, but is currently difficult. Several different methods 
give disparate results. A way out of this dilemma is suggested that involves 
modification of existing concepts of sleep and wakefulness to conclude the 
powerful influence of behaviour on sleep propensity. This propensity at a 
particular time depends, hypothetically, on a mutually inhibitory interaction 
between a sleep and a wake drive, not on the magnitude of either drive alone. 
Measurements of sleep propensity are partly situation-specific, whether measured 
objectively by laboratory tests or subjectively by a questionnaire such as the 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The latter is believed to measure a general 
characteristic, the average sleep propensity across a range of specified 
situations in daily life. Any one situational sleep propensity is not always an 
accurate predictor of another, even in the same subject. The Multiple Sleep 
Latency test should not be a gold standard for such measurements. Wider 
discussion and more research into ""sleepiness"" is needed.

BACKGROUND: Patients frequently sleep during hemodialysis (HD), a behavior often 
attributed to treatment-related fatigue and/or simple boredom. The possibility 
that this behavior reflects a more pervasive underlying increase in daytime 
sleepiness has never been systematically examined. Thus, we studied a sample of 
HD patients on an off-dialysis day to establish the presence or absence of 
daytime sleepiness independent of effects of treatment, quantify its severity, 
and identify associated demographic, metabolic, and sleep-related variables.
METHODS: Forty-six stable HD patients underwent polysomnography, followed the 
next day (a nondialysis day) by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT; low score 
= greater sleepiness), a measure of physiological daytime sleepiness. Subjects 
also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; high score = greater 
sleepiness), a measure of subjective daytime sleepiness.
RESULTS: One third (n = 15) of subjects had MSLT scores suggesting abnormal 
levels of physiological daytime sleepiness, and six subjects had scores 
consistent with severe, pathological sleepiness. Thirty percent (n = 14) had 
significant subjective daytime sleepiness as measured by the ESS. However, MSLT 
and ESS scores were unrelated. Higher indices of sleep apnea (r = -0.324; P = 
0.028) and brief arousals (r = -0.370; P = 0.009) correlated significantly with 
increased physiological, but not subjective, sleepiness. Longer nocturnal sleep 
latencies (r = 0.350; P = 0.017) and greater percentage of rapid-eye-movement 
sleep (r = 0.302; P = 0.042) were associated with decreased physiological 
sleepiness. Other major demographic, metabolic, and sleep-related variables did 
not correlate with MSLT scores, and none of the variables examined were related 
to ESS scores.
CONCLUSION: Daytime sleepiness is common in HD patients and may be severe 
despite the absence of obvious clinical risk factors for the condition. Thus, 
research designed to identify cost-effective indicators of daytime sleepiness 
and evaluate the detrimental effects of sleepiness on clinical outcomes in HD 
patients is warranted.

Sleep-wake habits and control of postural muscle tone were investigated by 
self-report questionnaire in 183 subjects considered to have the narcoleptic 
syndrome, 62 subjects with hypersomnia and 10 with obstructive sleep apnoea. 
Results were compared with those in a group of 188 control subjects with normal 
sleep wake habits. Excessive daytime sleepiness, determined by the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (ESS), was five times greater in the narcoleptic syndrome than 
in control subjects (score range 0-24, mean scores +/-SD 19.6+/-3.0; and 
4.5+/-3.3 respectively; P<0.001). The propensity to cataplexy, as determined by 
a rating scale developed to estimate the likelihood of loss of postural tone in 
response to sudden emotional stimuli, including laughter, was 10 times greater 
in narcoleptic syndrome than in control subjects (postural atonia total score 
range 0-600; mean + SD 334+/-122 and 28+/-45, respectively; P<0.001). 
Narcoleptics had more disturbances of night sleep than controls with episodes of 
muscle jerking, sleep walking, sleep talking and sleep terrors, as well as sleep 
paralysis, and higher insomnia self-rating scores. Sleep latency from bedtime to 
sleep-onset time was shorter in narcoleptics than controls. The hypersomniac 
group of 62 subjects was heterogeneous. Subsequent investigation showed that 18 
subjects (29%) had idiopathic hypersomnia, four (6%) 'incomplete' narcolepsy 
without cataplexy and 10 (16%) hypersomnia accompanying a mood disorder. The 
mean ESS scores in this group and in subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea were 
comparable to those of the narcoleptic syndrome subject group. Mean postural 
atonia scores were similar to those of control subjects.

Degrees of sleep apnoea and daytime sleepiness are quite common in community 
populations. However the relationship between the two is poor, although 
sleepiness does correlate better with a history of snoring. It has been 
suggested that sleep can be fragmented by upper airways obstructive events, 
short of full apnoeas or hypopnoeas, and that these events may not provoke full 
cortical arousal, but be detectable through activation of the autonomic system. 
Failure to detect both these could mask a relationship between 'sleep apnoea' 
and daytime sleepiness. We have therefore measured sleepiness (Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale) in addition to both autonomic 'arousals' and inspiratory 
effort (using pulse transit time) in 473 men and women at home. Although 
sleepiness was related to a history of snoring, it was not significantly 
predicted by the measures of autonomic 'arousal', or inspiratory effort. 
Reported snoring and objectively measured snoring correlated poorly. As in other 
studies, nocturnal hypoxic dips were correlated with obesity, age, alcohol 
consumption, drug usage and a history of snoring. These data make it unlikely 
that sleep fragmentation from subtle variants of sleep apnoea and 'autonomic' 
(or 'subcortical') arousals are an important source of daytime sleepiness in the 
community.

Basic models of sleepiness, focusing on the homeostatic and circadian components 
of sleepiness, are able to predict important fluctuations of sleepiness. 
However, they fail in explaining certain sleepiness phenomena, as for instance 
in insomnia patients. To meet this shortcoming, modern models incorporate the 
arousal component of sleepiness, in addition to the sleep drive. While these 
models mainly concentrate on short-term changes in sleepiness, ""state"" 
sleepiness, there are indications that a stable characteristic level of 
sleepiness, ""trait"" sleepiness, is also an important determinant of a person's 
level of sleepiness. This leads to a conceptualization of sleepiness in which 
situational factors modify a basal level of sleep drive and arousal. It implies 
that sleepiness is not a unitary concept and can reflect essentially different 
states. Multiple sleepiness assessment tools have been proposed in the past. The 
majority of them offer valuable information, but they do not grasp all aspects 
of sleepiness. We should bear in mind that tools for assessing sleepiness are 
always operationalizations reflecting the theoretical framework the investigator 
has on sleepiness. Hence, rather than searching for a gold standard for the 
measurement of sleepiness, future research effort should be aimed at linking the 
various measurement techniques with the hypothesized underlying components of 
sleepiness on a sound empirical basis.

OBJECTIVE: Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common symptom in obese patients, 
but what drives this condition is unclear. The objective was to look for 
clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, and polysomnographic predictors of 
excessive daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) 
in obese patients.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The ESS questionnaire was completed by 1,055 
consecutive patients presenting for obesity surgery. Those at high risk for 
obstructive sleep apnea (n = 331) had diagnostic overnight polysomnography 
preoperatively. All patients had preoperative clinical, hematologic, and 
biochemical measurements and completed multiple questionnaires.
RESULTS: There was no significant relationship between ESS score and any measure 
of diagnostic polysomnography factors, including total apnea hypopnea index. 
Subtle increases in ESS scores were reported in men, older patients, and those 
with type 2 diabetes. However, general demographic, anthropometric, and 
biochemical measures of the metabolic syndrome explained only 3% of ESS score 
variance, and inflammatory markers of C-reactive protein and total white cell 
count were not predictive. Poor Short Form-36 energy scores (b = -0.18, p < 
0.001) and high Beck Depression Inventory scores were predictive of higher ESS 
scores (b = 0.15, p < 0.001) and, along with increasing age and male gender, 
explained 10% of variance. Symptoms related to disturbed nocturnal sleep 
explained 30% of variance.
CONCLUSION: In severely obese subjects, increased daytime sleepiness does not 
seem to be driven by obstructive sleep apnea, the degree of obesity, or 
anthropometric, metabolic, or inflammatory markers of the metabolic syndrome. It 
is, however, associated with poor energy, symptoms of depression, and symptoms 
of nocturnal sleep disturbance.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Daytime sleepiness is a pervasive problem that is associated 
with a significant public-health burden. Although self-reported measures of 
daytime sleepiness may be useful in identifying at-risk individuals, there is 
significant controversy because there are no population-based data relating 
subjective and objective measures of daytime sleep tendency. The aims of this 
study were to examine the associations between the Multiple Sleep Latency Test 
(MSLT), an objective measure of daytime sleep tendency, and self-reported 
information on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and nighttime sleep duration 
in the general population.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based sample of 261 women and 371 men, mean 
age of 50.8 years, enrolled in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study.
MEASUREMENTS: MSLT, ESS, and self-reported sleep duration prior to the MSLT.
RESULTS: Using survival analysis to model the time to sleep onset during the 
MSLT, we found that individuals with an intermediate (6-11) and high (> or = 12) 
ESS score had a 30% and 69% increase in risk for sleep onset during the MSLT, 
respectively, compared to individuals with a low ESS score (< or = 5). A 
dose-response relationship between self-reported duration of nighttime sleep and 
objective sleep tendency was also observed. Compared to individuals reporting 
more than 7.50 hours of sleep (highest tertile), individuals reporting 6.75 to 
7.50 hours and less than 6.75 hours (lowest tertile) had a 27% and 73% increase 
in risk for sleep onset during the MSLT, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjective reports of daytime sleep tendency on the ESS and the 
duration of nighttime sleep are associated with the results of the MSLT in the 
general population.

INTRODUCTION: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and fatigue occur in high 
percentages in the general population. They are common complaints in primary 
care and in specialty medicine. Although they may represent distinct or 
overlapping phenomena, the general medical literature does not normally 
distinguish between EDS and fatigue. Despite their prevalence, both EDS and 
fatigue are identified and treated in a relatively small proportion of those 
affected. The similarity of EDS and fatigue may create diagnostic ambiguity and 
thereby contribute to under-identification and under-treatment. Fatigue, in 
particular, is thought to be difficult to manage when it is identified.
METHODS: The literature was searched for reviews, meta-analysis and similar 
levels of papers focused on EDS or fatigue.
RESULTS: EDS and fatigue are operationalized in ways that contribute to blurring 
rather than to distinguishing between them. Existing measures of both EDS and 
fatigue may also contribute to their misidentification. Effective treatments for 
both symptoms have been established. Behavioral interventions are effective and 
underutilized.
DISCUSSION: We suggest more precise operationalization of EDS and fatigue, 
leading to a refinement of existing measures or development of new tools, a 
structured interview with fatigue and EDS sections in the clinical setting, and 
more consideration for behavioral interventions.

Manual continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration in a sleep 
laboratory is costly and limits access for diagnostic studies. Many factors 
affect CPAP compliance, but education and support, rather than in-laboratory 
CPAP titration, appear to be pivotal. Self-adjustment of CPAP at home will 
provide equal or superior efficacy in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) as compared with in-laboratory titration. A randomized, single-blind, 
two-period crossover trial of CPAP treatment at the in-laboratory-determined 
optimal pressure versus at-home self-adjustment of CPAP (starting pressure based 
on prediction equation). Eighteen CPAP-naive patients (16 males, 50 +/- 15 years 
old, apnea hypopnea index 40 +/- 20) with a new diagnosis of OSA were tested. 
Testing was performed before and after CPAP treatment in each of two 5-week 
study limbs. CPAP, compliance with CPAP treatment, the Sleep Apnea Quality of 
Life Index, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire score, the Epworth 
sleepiness scale score, sleep architecture, sleep apnea severity, and 
maintenance of wakefulness tests were performed. Both modes of CPAP treatment 
significantly improved objective and subjective measures of OSA, but they did 
not differ in efficacy. Home self-titration of CPAP is as effective as 
in-laboratory manual titration in the management of patients with OSA.

This study investigated whether a sensitive, physiological measure of 
alertness/sleepiness, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), was related to 
neuropsychological test performance in elderly individuals. We hypothesized that 
the greater likelihood of falling asleep during the daytime on the MSLT would be 
related to relatively poorer performances on a variety of neuropsychological 
tests. Results from a homogeneous sample of 35 relatively well-educated, high 
functioning, elderly community volunteers confirmed the presence of 
characteristic levels of daytime alertness which were stable within individuals 
(r = .70 to .73) and showed large variation across individuals (coefficients of 
variation: 54-84%). Despite this wide intersubject variability, MSLT-defined 
alertness/sleepiness was unrelated to neuropsychological test results. We 
discuss these results in terms of the performance deficits known to accompany 
sleepiness in experimental studies of sleep deprivation and in terms of the 
behavioral slowing known to occur in normal aging.

PURPOSE: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in older adults is associated with 
obstructive sleep apnea, falls, reduced quality of life, and mortality. The 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is widely used to assess sleepiness. However, EDS 
assessment with the ESS may not be accurate in older adults. We aimed to (1) 
describe the responsiveness of nondemented older subjects to the ESS and (2) 
compare the self-report ESS scores to those of close relatives (CR) proxy and 
identify factors influencing any discrepancies between them.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study including 104 
independently living nondemented older subjects with daytime sleepiness 
complaints and 104 nondemented CRs. Cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State 
Examination) and the ESS were completed separately by subjects and CRs to assess 
the subject's daytime sleepiness.
RESULTS: Almost 60 % of subjects and CRs were not able to answer at least one 
question on the ESS. Despite the fact that all subjects complained of EDS, only 
24 % of them had an abnormal ESS score (>10). Subjects rated their sleepiness 
lower (7.10 ± 4.31) than their CR proxy did (9.70 ± 5.14) (p < 0.0001). In 
multivariate analysis, an increase in age and a decrease in cognitive status of 
the subjects appeared related to the difference in ESS between subject and CR.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of older adults were not able to answer all of the ESS 
items. The ESS may underestimate sleepiness severity in older subjects. Despite 
EDS complaints in all subjects, only one quarter of them had a pathological ESS 
score.

Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious and prevalent medical 
condition with major consequences for health and safety. Excessive daytime 
sleepiness (EDS) is a common-but not universal-accompanying symptom. The purpose 
of this literature analysis is to understand whether the presence/absence of EDS 
is associated with different physiopathologic, prognostic, and therapeutic 
outcomes in OSA patients. Methods: Articles in English published in PubMed, 
Medline, and EMBASE between January 2000 and June 2017, focusing on no-EDS OSA 
patients, were critically reviewed. Results: A relevant percentage of OSA 
patients do not complain of EDS. EDS is a significant and independent predictor 
of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is associated with all-cause 
mortality and an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Male gender, 
younger age, high body mass index, are predictors of EDS. The positive effects 
of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on blood pressure, 
insulin resistance, fatal and non-fatal CVD, and endothelial dysfunction risk 
factors have been demonstrated in EDS-OSA patients, but results are inconsistent 
in no-EDS patients. The most sustainable cause of EDS is nocturnal hypoxemia and 
alterations of sleep architecture, including sleep fragmentation. These changes 
are less evident in no-EDS patients that seem less susceptible to the cortical 
effects of apneas. Conclusions: There is no consensus if we should consider OSA 
as a single disease with different phenotypes with or without EDS, or if there 
are different diseases with different genetic/epigenetic determinants, 
pathogenic mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment.The small number of studies 
focused on this issue indicates the need for further research in this area. 
Clinicians must carefully assess the presence or absence of EDS and decide 
accordingly the treatment. This approach could improve combination therapy 
targeted to a patient's specific pathology to enhance both efficacy and 
long-term adherence to OSA treatment and significantly reduce the social, 
economic, and health negative impact of OSA.

The aim of our study was to investigate age-related changes in sleepiness 
symptoms associated with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Wisconsin Sleep 
Cohort participants were assessed using polysomnography, the Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale (ESS) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). SDB was defined as an 
apnoea/hypopnoea index ≥15 events·h(-1), and sleepiness as ESS ≥10 and MSLT ≤5 
min. Odds ratios were calculated using generalised estimating equations 
associating sleepiness with SDB, and conditional logistic regression examining 
changes in longitudinal sleepiness status (ESS only). Models were a priori 
stratified by sex. ESS was measured in 1,281 participants and MSLT in 998 at 
multiple time-points (ESS n=3,695; MSLT n=1,846). Significant interactions were 
found between SDB and age in males, but not females. The odds ratios modelled 
for sleepiness in a 40-yr-old male with SDB were significant compared to a male 
without SDB (ESS 2.1 and MSLT 2.9); however, these associations were not 
significant at 60 yrs of age. The within-subject odds ratio for sleepiness was 
also significant at 40 yrs of age (OR 3.4), but not at 60 yrs of age. The 
age-related reductions in the association between sleepiness and SDB may have 
clinical implications for the diagnosis and treatment of SDB in older people as 
sleepiness is often used as a therapeutic target.

Up to 12% of the general population experience excessive daytime sleepiness 
(EDS), with increasing prevalence in the elderly. EDS may lead to cognitive 
impairment, resulting in inattentiveness, poor memory, mood disorders and an 
increased risk of accidents. As a result, quality of life is reduced in most 
patients with EDS as well as in their caregiving spouses. There are a variety of 
causes leading to EDS, including CNS pathology, neurological dysfunction, 
associated sleep disorders with insufficient or fragmented sleep, and drug 
therapy. Since EDS accompanies many neurological disorders, such as 
neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases, neurologists should be familiar 
with the diagnosis, its major causes and with treatment options. The main focus 
of this article is on movement disorders, neuromuscular diseases, multiple 
sclerosis, dementia, cerebrovascular diseases, head and brain trauma, pain and 
epilepsy. General management strategies for EDS in all these neurological 
diseases include sleep hygiene aspects such as extensions of noctural time in 
bed and frequent naps during the day. Pharmacological treatment is generally 
achieved with stimulants such as amphetamine, methylphenidate and pemoline, or 
newer compounds such as modafinil.

BACKGROUND: The identification of the gene mutation causing Huntington disease 
has raised hopes for new treatments to ease symptoms and slow functional 
decline. As such, there has been a push towards designing efficient 
pharmacological trials (i.e., drug trials), especially with regard to selecting 
outcomes measures that are both brief and sensitive to changes across the course 
of the disease, from subtle prodromal changes, to more severe end-stage changes.
OBJECTIVES: Recently, to aid in efficient development of new HD research 
studies, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) 
published recommendations for measurement selection in HD. While these 
recommendations are helpful, many of the recommended measures have little 
published data in HD. As such, we conducted a systematic review of the 
literature to identify the most common outcomes measures used in HD clinical 
trials.
METHODS: Major medical databases, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were used to identify 
peer-reviewed journal articles in English from 2001 through April 2013; 151 
pharmacological trials were identified.
RESULTS: The majority of HD clinical trials employed clinician-reported outcomes 
measures (93%); patient reported outcome measures (11%) and observer reported 
outcome measures (3%) were used with much less frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a review of the most commonly used measures across these 
trials, compare these measures to the clinical recommendations made by the NINDS 
working groups, and provide recommendations for selecting measures for future 
clinical trials that meet the Food and Drug Administration standards.

OBJECTIVE: We examined sleep, daytime sleepiness and the ability to stay awake 
during the day in patients affected with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), to further 
delineate the role of photoreceptors in the circadian cycle.
METHODS: Twelve individuals diagnosed with RP (40 +/- 8 years) And 12 normally 
sighted healthy individuals (39 +/- 7 years) matched for age, body mass index 
(BMI) and sex were selected for the study. Participants had their sleep recorded 
on two consecutive nights and were monitored on the two following days. On the 
first day, their ability to stay awake and on the second, their sleep propensity 
were assessed using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the Multiple 
Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), respectively. Self-report measures were obtained 
using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
(ESS), and the Toronto Hospital Alertness Test (THAT).
RESULTS: Subjective daytime sleepiness (ESS: 9 +/- 5 vs. 6 +/- 4, P=0.053) and 
objectively measured sleep propensity (MSLT: 10 +/- 5 vs. 17 +/- 3 min, P < 
0.000) were significantly higher in RP patients than controls, whilst their 
alertness (THAT: 29 +/- 9 vs. 38 +/- 7, P=0.016) and ability to stay awake (MWT: 
21 +/- 9 vs. 29 +/- 2 min, P=0.006) were significantly reduced. Retinitis 
pigmentosa participants had more disturbed nighttime sleep, with significantly 
more awakenings (arousal index: 14 +/- 8 vs. 8 +/- 6 h, P=0.039), and tended to 
have less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (19 +/- 5 vs. 22 +/- 3%, P=0.094).
CONCLUSION: Patients with RP have increased daytime sleepiness, reduced 
alertness and more disturbed nighttime sleep of poorer quality than their 
normally sighted counterparts, suggesting an influence of photoreceptor 
degeneration on the circadian cycle.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate reliability of single objective tests in assessing 
sleepiness.
DESIGN: Subjects who completed polysomnography underwent a 4-nap multiple sleep 
latency test (MSLT) the following day. Prior to each nap opportunity on MSLT, 
subjects performed the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) and divided attention 
driving task (DADT). Results of single versus multiple test administrations were 
compared using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and adjusted for 
test administration order effects to explore time of day effects. Measures were 
explored as continuous and binary (i.e., impaired or not impaired).
SETTING: Community-based sample evaluated at a tertiary, university-based sleep 
center.
PARTICIPANTS: 372 adult commercial vehicle operators oversampled for increased 
obstructive sleep apnea risk.
INTERVENTIONS: N/A.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: AS CONTINUOUS MEASURES, ICC WERE AS FOLLOWS: MSLT 
0.45, PVT median response time 0.69, PVT number of lapses 0.51, 10-min DADT 
tracking error 0.87, 20-min DADT tracking error 0.90. Based on binary outcomes, 
ICC were: MSLT 0.63, PVT number of lapses 0.85, 10-min DADT 0.95, 20-min DADT 
0.96. Statistically significant time of day effects were seen in both the MSLT 
and PVT but not the DADT. Correlation between ESS and different objective tests 
was strongest for MSLT, range [-0.270 to -0.195] and persisted across all time 
points.
CONCLUSIONS: Single DADT and PVT administrations are reliable measures of 
sleepiness. A single MSLT administration can reasonably discriminate individuals 
with MSL < 8 minutes. These results support the use of a single administration 
of some objective tests of sleepiness when performed under controlled conditions 
in routine clinical care.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the measurement properties and hierarchical 
item structure of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) in patients with 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Data were taken from a cross-sectional study regarding 
fatigue and sleep-related aspects of PD. One hundred and eighteen consecutive 
patients with neurologist-diagnosed PD without significant co-morbidities (54% 
men; mean age, 64 years; mean PD duration, 8.4 years) from four Swedish 
neurological outpatient clinics participated. The ESS displayed good data 
quality with few missing items (0-2.5%): good reliability (Cronbach's alpha, 
0.84), marginal floor and no ceiling effects (1.7% and 0% respectively), and 
differentiated between those reporting problems staying awake during the past 
month and those who did not. Item-total correlations, factor and Rasch analyses 
indicated that items tap a single underlying construct. Rasch analysis supported 
basic rating scale assumptions and demonstrated an item hierarchy similar to 
that previously found in patients with other sleep disorders. Gaps in the levels 
of sleep propensity covered by ESS items and their response options were 
identified at the higher and lower ends of the underlying sleepiness continuum. 
This study provides an evidence base for using the ESS in PD by demonstrating 
good psychometric properties and a stable hierarchical item structure. However, 
addition of new items and use of Rasch scoring has potential to further enhance 
the clinical usefulness of the ESS.

BACKGROUND: Excessive sleepiness often goes unrecognized in the primary care 
setting despite its high prevalence and deleterious effects on both individual 
and public safety. Patients with neurologic and psychiatric illnesses, as well 
as those with acute and chronic medical conditions, plus those with sleep 
disorders, often have symptoms of excessive sleepiness, tiredness, and fatigue. 
Recognition and prompt treatment of these symptoms are important, even though 
their etiology may not be immediately understood. This review focuses on the 
underlying causes, consequences, identification, and treatment of excessive 
sleepiness.
DATA SOURCES: A search of the literature to 2007 was performed using the PubMed 
search engine. English-language articles were identified using the following 
search terms: excessive sleepiness, fatigue, circadian rhythm, obstructive sleep 
apnea, shift work disorder, narcolepsy, drowsy driving, and wakefulness. 
Additional references were identified through bibliography reviews of relevant 
articles.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Current assessments of the prevalence, consequences, and 
etiologies of excessive sleepiness, with leading treatment strategies, were 
extracted, reviewed, and summarized to meet the objectives of this article.
CONCLUSIONS: Excessive sleepiness is associated with a wide range of medical, 
neurologic, and psychiatric disorders frequently seen in primary care practice. 
Excessive sleepiness is a serious, debilitating, potentially life-threatening 
condition, yet also treatable, and it is important to initiate appropriate 
intervention as early as possible. Physicians should place increasing emphasis 
on the substantial benefits that accompany improvements in wakefulness.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is associated with 
increased mortality in older adults, yet sleep disordered breathing (SDB), a 
common cause of sleepiness, has not been shown to increase mortality in older 
adults. This study examined the relationship between daytime sleepiness, SDB, 
self-report sleep parameters, and mortality in older adults.
DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study.
SETTING: Clinical and Translational Research Center, at-home testing.
PARTICIPANTS: 289 study participants (age >65, no dementia or depression at the 
time of enrollment) classified as having EDS (n=146) or not (n=143).
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Study participants underwent in-lab polysomnography 
and multiple sleep latency testing at cohort inception. Survival analysis was 
conducted, with an average follow-up of 13.8 years. Excessive daytime sleepiness 
was associated with an unadjusted mortality hazard ratio of 1.5 (95% CI 
1.1-2.0). The unadjusted mortality hazard ratio for study participants with both 
EDS and SDB (apnea-hypopnea index ≥20 events/h) was 2.7, 95% CI: 1.8-4.2. These 
findings persisted with an adjusted mortality hazard ratio of 2.3, 95% CI: 
1.5-3.6 in the final model that included other covariates associated with 
increased mortality (sleep duration >8.5 h, self-reported angina, male gender, 
African American race, and age).
CONCLUSION: The presence of SDB is an important risk factor for mortality from 
excessive daytime sleepiness in older adults. In the presence of SDB at an AHI 
≥20 events/h, EDS was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in 
older adults, even when adjusting for other significant risk factors, such as 
prolonged sleep duration. In older patients who had SDB without EDS, or EDS 
without SDB, there was no increased all-cause mortality rate.

BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia is a common health problem with substantial 
consequences in older adults. Cognitive behavioral treatments are efficacious 
but not widely available. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of 
brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBTI) vs an information control (IC) 
condition.
METHODS: A total of 79 older adults (mean age, 71.7 years; 54 women [70%]) with 
chronic insomnia and common comorbidities were recruited from the community and 
1 primary care clinic. Participants were randomly assigned to either BBTI, 
consisting of individualized behavioral instructions delivered in 2 intervention 
sessions and 2 telephone calls, or IC, consisting of printed educational 
material. Both interventions were delivered by a nurse clinician. The primary 
outcome was categorically defined treatment response at 4 weeks, based on sleep 
questionnaires and diaries. Secondary outcomes included self-report symptom and 
health measures, sleep diaries, actigraphy, and polysomnography.
RESULTS: Categorically defined response (67% [n = 26] vs 25% [n = 10]; χ(2) = 
13.8) (P < .001) and the proportion of participants without insomnia (55% [n = 
21] vs 13% [n = 5]; χ(2) = 15.5) (P < .001) were significantly higher for BBTI 
than for IC. The number needed to treat was 2.4 for each outcome. No 
differential effects were found for subgroups according to hypnotic or 
antidepressant use, sleep apnea, or recruitment source. The BBTI produced 
significantly better outcomes in self-reported sleep and health (group × time 
interaction, F(5,73) = 5.99, P < .001), sleep diary (F(8,70) = 4.32, P < .001), 
and actigraphy (F(4,74) = 17.72, P < .001), but not polysomnography. 
Improvements were maintained at 6 months.
CONCLUSION: We found that BBTI is a simple, efficacious, and durable 
intervention for chronic insomnia in older adults that has potential for 
dissemination across medical settings.
