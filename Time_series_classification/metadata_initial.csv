Land-cover change has been identified as an important cause or driving force of global climate change and is a significant research topic. Over the past few decades, global land-cover mapping has progressed; however, long-time-series global land-cover-change monitoring data are still sparse, especially those at 30 m resolution. In this study, we describe GLC_FCS30D, a novel global 30 m land-cover dynamics monitoring dataset containing 35 land-cover subcategories and covering the period 1985–2022 in 26 time steps (maps were updated every 5 years before 2000 and annually after 2000). GLC_FCS30D has been developed using continuous change detection and all available Landsat imagery based on the Google Earth Engine platform. Specifically, we first take advantage of the continuous change-detection model and the full time series of Landsat observations to capture the time points of changed pixels and identify the temporally stable areas. Then, we apply a spatiotemporal refinement method to derive the globally distributed and high-confidence training samples from these temporally stable areas. Next, local adaptive classification models are used to update the land-cover information for the changed pixels, and a temporal-consistency optimization algorithm is adopted to improve their temporal stability and suppress some false changes. Further, the GLC_FCS30D product is validated using 84 526 globally distributed validation samples from 2020. It achieves an overall accuracy of 80.88 % (±0.27 %) for the basic classification system (10 major land-cover types) and 73.04 % (±0.30 %) for the LCCS (Land Cover Classification System) level-1 validation system (17 LCCS land-cover types). Meanwhile, two third-party time-series datasets used for validation from the United States and Europe Union are also collected for analyzing accuracy variations, and the results show that GLC_FCS30D offers significant stability in terms of variation across the accuracy time series and achieves mean accuracies of 79.50 % (±0.50 %) and 81.91 % (±0.09 %) over the two regions. Lastly, we draw conclusions about the global land-cover-change information from the GLC_FCS30D dataset; namely, that forest and cropland variations have dominated global land-cover change over past 37 years, the net loss of forests reached about 2.5 million km2, and the net gain in cropland area is approximately 1.3 million km2. Therefore, the novel dataset GLC_FCS30D is an accurate land-cover-dynamics time-series monitoring product that benefits from its diverse classification system, high spatial resolution, and long time span (1985–2022); thus, it will effectively support global climate change research and promote sustainable development analysis. The GLC_FCS30D dataset is available via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8239305 (Liu et al., 2023).

Existing methods for MedTS classification primarily rely on handcrafted biomarkers extraction and CNN-based models, with limited exploration of transformer-based models. In this paper, we introduce Medformer, a multi-granularity patching transformer tailored specifically for MedTS classification. Our method incorporates three novel mechanisms to leverage the unique characteristics of MedTS: cross-channel patching to leverage inter-channel correlations, multi-granularity embedding for capturing features at different scales, and two-stage (intra- and inter-granularity) multi-granularity self-attention for learning features and correlations within and among granularities. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets under both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent setups. Results demonstrate Medformer's superiority over 10 baselines, achieving top averaged ranking across five datasets on all six evaluation metrics. These findings underscore the significant impact of our method on healthcare applications, such as diagnosing Myocardial Infarction, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.

Rock glaciers play an important part of the water budget in high mountain areas and recent studies suggest that they may even act as climate‐resistant water storages. In this study we present the first rock glacier inventory of this region containing 1,433 rock glaciers over an area of 4,622 km. To create the most reliable inventory we combine manually created rock glacier outlines with an automated classification approach. The manual outlines were generated based on surface elevation data, optical satellite imagery and a surface velocity estimation. This estimation was generated via InSAR time series analysis with Sentinel‐1 data from 2016 to 2019. Our pixel‐based automated classification was able to correctly identify 87.8% of all rock glaciers in the study area at a true positive rate of 69.5%. In total, 65.9% of rock glaciers are classified as transitional with surface velocities of 1–10 cm/yr. In total, 18.5% are classified as active with higher velocities of up to 87 cm/yr. The southern windward side of the mountain range contains more numerous and more active rock glaciers. We attribute this to higher moisture availability supplied by the Indian Monsoon."

For such applications, it is essential to accurately track the user’s current fitness activity using available mobile sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to produce strong results in different time series classification tasks, including the recognition of daily living activities. However, fitness activities can present unique challenges to the human activity recognition task (HAR), including greater similarity between individual activities and fewer available data for model training. In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of CNNs to the fitness activity recognition task (FAR) using IMU data and determine the impact of input data size and sensor count on performance. For this purpose, we adapted three existing CNN architectures to the FAR task and designed a fourth CNN variant, which we call the scaling fully convolutional network (Scaling-FCN). We designed a preprocessing pipeline and recorded a running exercise data set with 20 participants, in which we evaluated the respective recognition performances of the four networks, comparing them with three traditional machine learning (ML) methods commonly used in HAR. Although CNN architectures achieve at least 94% test accuracy in all scenarios, two traditional ML architectures surpass them in the default scenario, with support vector machines (SVMs) achieving 99.00 ± 0.34% test accuracy. The removal of all sensors except one foot sensor reduced the performance of traditional ML architectures but improved the performance of CNN architectures on our data set, with our Scaling-FCN reaching the highest accuracy of 99.86 ± 0.11% on the test set. Our results suggest that CNNs are generally well suited for fitness activity recognition, and noticeable performance improvements can be achieved if sensors are dropped selectively, although traditional ML architectures can still compete with or even surpass CNNs when favorable input data are utilized."

Recently, exploiting transformers for MTSC has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods focus on generic features, providing a comprehensive understanding of data, but they ignore class-specific features crucial for learning the representative characteristics of each class. This leads to poor performance in the case of imbalanced datasets or datasets with similar overall patterns but differing in minor class-specific details. In this paper, we propose a novel Shapelet Transformer (ShapeFormer), which comprises class-specific and generic transformer modules to capture both of these features. In the class-specific module, we introduce the discovery method to extract the discriminative subsequences of each class (i.e. shapelets) from the training set. We then propose a Shapelet Filter to learn the difference features between these shapelets and the input time series. We found that the difference feature for each shapelet contains important class-specific features, as it shows a significant distinction between its class and others. In the generic module, convolution filters are used to extract generic features that contain information to distinguish among all classes. For each module, we employ the transformer encoder to capture the correlation between their features. As a result, the combination of two transformer modules allows our model to exploit the power of both types of features, thereby enhancing the classification performance. Our experiments on 30 UEA MTSC datasets demonstrate that ShapeFormer has achieved the highest accuracy ranking compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Typically, entropy methods are employed to quantify the complexity of the time-series for classifying. Traditional entropy methods focus on the frequency distribution of all the observations in a time-series. This requires a relatively long time-series with at least a couple of thousands of data points, which limits their usages in practical applications. The methods are also sensitive to the parameter settings. In this paper, we propose a conceptually new approach called attention entropy, which pays attention only to the key observations. Instead of counting the frequency of all observations, it analyzes the frequency distribution of the intervals between the key observations in a time-series. Attention entropy does not need any parameter to tune, it is robust to the time-series length, and requires only linear time to compute. Experiments show that it outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art entropy methods evaluated by real-world datasets. It achieves average classification accuracy of AUC = 0.71 while the second-best method, multiscale entropy, achieves AUC = 0.62 when classifying four groups of people with a time-series length of 100."

Recently, using transformers to solve MTSC has been reported. However, current transformer-based methods take data points of individual timestamps as inputs (timestamp-level), which only capture the temporal dependencies, not the dependencies among variables. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, called SVP-T. Specifically, we ﬁrst propose to take time series subsequences, which can be from different variables and positions (time interval), as the inputs (shape-level). The temporal and variable dependencies are both handled by capturing the long- and short-term dependencies among shapes. Second, we propose a variable-position encoding layer (VP-layer) to utilize both the variable and position information of each shape. Third, we introduce a novel VP-based (Variable-Position) self-attention mechanism to allow the enhancing the attention weights of overlapping shapes. We evaluate our method on all UEA MTS datasets. SVP-T achieves the best accuracy rank when compared with several competitive state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the VP-layer and the VP-based self-attention mechanism. Finally, we present one case study to interpret the result of SVP-T."

We will show how to easily reproduce published results and how to compare a new algorithm to state-of-the-art. Finally, we will work through real world examples from the field of Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification and regression. EEG machine learning tasks arise in medicine, brain-computer interface research and psychology. We use these problems to how to compare algorithms on problems from a single domain and how to deal with data with different characteristics, such as missing values, unequal length and high dimensionality. The latest advances in the fields of time series classification and regression are all available through the aeon toolkit, an open source, scikit-learn compatible framework for time series machine learning which we use to provide our code examples."

Time series classification (TSC) is the task of assigning a time series to one of a set of predefined classes, usually based on a model learned from examples. Dictionary-based methods for TSC rely on counting the frequency of certain patterns in time series and are important components of the currently most accurate TSC ensembles. One of the early dictionary-based methods was WEASEL, which at its time achieved SotA results while also being very fast. However, it is outperformed both in terms of speed and accuracy by other methods. Furthermore, its design leads to an unpredictably large memory footprint, making it inapplicable for many applications. In this paper, we present WEASEL 2.0, a complete overhaul of WEASEL based on two recent advancements in TSC: Dilation and ensembling of randomized hyper-parameter settings. These two techniques allow WEASEL 2.0 to work with a fixed-size memory footprint while at the same time improving accuracy. Compared to 15 other SotA methods on the UCR benchmark set, WEASEL 2.0 is significantly more accurate than other dictionary methods and not significantly worse than the currently best methods. Actually, it achieves the highest median accuracy over all data sets, and it performs best in 5 out of 12 problem classes.

Although optical remote sensing has been widely used to monitor crop dynamics, data are not always available due to cloud and other atmospheric effects on optical sensors. Satellite microwave systems such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) have all-time and all-weather advantages in monitoring ground and crop conditions, combining optical imagery and SAR imagery for crop type classification is of great significance. Our study mainly proposes seven feature combination schemes based on the combination of multi-temporal spectral features and texture features of Sentinel-2 (S2), and radar backscattering features of Sentinel-1 (S1) evaluate the influence of different data sources and different features on classification accuracy, obtains the optimal classification strategy and analyses the contribution of different features to classification result, in the aim of providing a new technical approach for the fine identification of crops from multi-source remote-sensing data. Results show that the crop classification accuracy of combined multi-time series spectral, texture, and radar features is higher than that of combining two types of features. The features subset selected by multi-period spectral, texture, and radar features have the best classification result, the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficients reach 96.40% and 0.93, respectively. The study provides a method reference for future research on larger-scale remote-sensing crop precise extraction."

Unlike NLP and CV where a unified model can be used to perform different tasks, specially designed approach still dominates in each time series analysis task such as classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and few-shot learning. The main challenge that blocks the development of pre-trained model for time series analysis is the lack of a large amount of data for training. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging language or CV models, pre-trained from billions of tokens, for time series analysis. Specifically, we refrain from altering the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks in the pre-trained language or image model. This model, known as the Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), is evaluated through fine-tuning on all major types of tasks involving time series. Our results demonstrate that pre-trained models on natural language or images can lead to a comparable or state-of-the-art performance in all main time series analysis tasks, as illustrated in Figure 1. We also found both theoretically and empirically that the self-attention module behaviors similarly to principle component analysis (PCA), an observation that helps explains how transformer bridges the domain gap and a crucial step towards understanding the universality of a pre-trained transformer.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/DAMO-DI-ML/One_Fits_All."

However, most state-of-the-art focuses on improving classification performance, with the best-performing models typically opaque. Interpretable multivariate time series classifiers have been recently introduced, but none can maintain sufficient levels of efficiency and effectiveness together with interpretability. We introduce Z-Time , a novel algorithm for effective and efficient interpretable multivariate time series classification. Z-Time employs temporal abstraction and temporal relations of event intervals to create interpretable features across multiple time series dimensions. In our experimental evaluation on the UEA multivariate time series datasets, Z-Time achieves comparable effectiveness to state-of-the-art non-interpretable multivariate classifiers while being faster than all interpretable multivariate classifiers. We also demonstrate that Z-Time is more robust to missing values and inter-dimensional orders, compared to its interpretable competitors."

Labels in clinical datasets are very often insufficient. One way to address this challenge is leveraging self-supervision. This paradigm attempts to identify a supervisory signal inherent within a dataset to serve as a surrogate label. We present a novel form of self-supervision: dynamics of clinical MTS. Unlike other self-supervision methods, such as masking, that are intuitive but still heuristic, we suggest to learn a representation justified by Koopman theory. The latter was shown useful for representing clinical time series and can be used as a form of surrogate task to improve the clinical MTS classification. In the ECG task, we show that our proposed framework achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline over numerous common diagnoses. For EEG abnormality classification, our proposed framework also achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than the SOTA baseline. All results are statistically significant. Our technique yields reliable clinical diagnosis in an empirical study employing signals from thousands of patients in multiple clinical tasks employing two types of clinical-grade sensors (ECG and EEG) as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning. Leveraging time-series-dynamics self-supervision can help mitigate the lack of labels in clinical datasets used for training machine learning algorithms and significantly improve their performance. Specifically, the ECG system presented in this work is being trialed in hospitals, used by top cardiologists for patient diagnosis and treatment. We believe that the deployment of such cutting-edge technology will significantly improve the accuracy and speed of cardiac assessments."

In particular, we propose to learn time series classifiers that maximize the minimum recall of the classes rather than the accuracy. Consequently, we manage to obtain classifiers which tend to give the same importance to all the classes. Unfortunately, for most of the traditional classifiers, learning to maximize the minimum recall of the classes is not trivial (if possible), since it can distort the nature of the classifiers themselves. Neural networks, in contrast, are classifiers that explicitly define a loss function, allowing it to be modified. Given that the minimum recall is not a differentiable function, and therefore does not allow the use of common gradient-based learning methods, we apply and evaluate several smooth approximations of the minimum recall function. A thorough experimental evaluation shows that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods used in imbalanced time series classification, obtaining higher recall values for the minority classes, incurring only a slight loss in accuracy."

These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classification archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difficult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classifiers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are significantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only nine of these algorithms are significantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classifier, the collective of transformation ensembles, is significantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more robust testing of new algorithms in the future."

Over recent years, a new set of TSC algorithms have been developed which have made significant improvement over the previous state of the art. The main focus has been on univariate TSC, i.e. the problem where each case has a single series and a class label. In reality, it is more common to encounter multivariate TSC (MTSC) problems where the time series for a single case has multiple dimensions. Despite this, much less consideration has been given to MTSC than the univariate case. The UCR archive has provided a valuable resource for univariate TSC, and the lack of a standard set of test problems may explain why there has been less focus on MTSC. The UEA archive of 30 MTSC problems released in 2018 has made comparison of algorithms easier. We review recently proposed bespoke MTSC algorithms based on deep learning, shapelets and bag of words approaches. If an algorithm cannot naturally handle multivariate data, the simplest approach to adapt a univariate classifier to MTSC is to ensemble it over the multivariate dimensions. We compare the bespoke algorithms to these dimension independent approaches on the 26 of the 30 MTSC archive problems where the data are all of equal length. We demonstrate that four classifiers are significantly more accurate than the benchmark dynamic time warping algorithm and that one of these recently proposed classifiers, ROCKET, achieves significant improvement on the archive datasets in at least an order of magnitude less time than the other three."

Hydrological and biogeochemical processes in wetlands vary strongly among these ecosystem patches. To date, most remote sensing classification approaches for wetland vegetation either rely on coarse images that cannot capture the spatial variability of wetland vegetation or rely on very-high-resolution multi-spectral images that are detailed but very sporadic in time (less than once per year). This study aimed to use NDVI time series, generated from NASA’s HLS dataset, to classify vegetation patches. We demonstrate our approach at a temperate, coastal lake, estuarine marsh. To classify vegetation patches, a standard time series library of the four land-cover patch types was built from referencing specific locations that were identified as “pure” pixels. These were identified using a single-time high-resolution image. We calculated the distance between the HLS-NDVI time series at each pixel and the “pure”-pixel standards for each land-cover type. The resulting true-positive classified rate was >73% for all patch types other than water lily. The classification accuracy was higher in pixels of a more uniform composition. A set of vegetation maps was created for the years 2016 to 2020 at our research site to identify the vegetation changes at the site as it is affected by rapid water elevation increases in Lake Erie. Our results reveal how changes in water elevation have changed the patch distribution in significant ways, leading to the local extinction of cattail by 2019 and a continuous increase in the area cover of water lily patches."

This study aims to produce a crop-type map with acceptable accuracy and spatial resolution in northern Mongolia by optimizing the combination of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) images with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. A total of three satellite data combination scenarios are set, including S1 alone, S2 alone, and the combination of S1 and S2. In order to avoid the impact of data gaps caused by clouds on crop classification, this study reconstructed the time series of S1 and S2 with a 10-day interval using the median composite method, linear moving interpolation, and Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter. Our results indicated that crop-type classification accuracy increased with the increase in data length to all three data combination scenarios. S2 alone has higher accuracy than S1 alone and the combination of S1 and S2. The crop-type map with the highest accuracy was generated using S2 data from 150 days of the year (DOY) (11 May) to 260 DOY (18 September). The OA and kappa were 0.93 and 0.78, respectively, and the F1-score for spring wheat and rapeseed were 0.96 and 0.80, respectively. The classification accuracy of the crop increased rapidly from 210 DOY (end of July) to 260 DOY (August to mid-September), and then it remained stable after 260 DOY. Based on our analysis, we filled the gap of the crop-type map with 10 m spatial resolution in northern Mongolia, revealing the best satellite combination and the best period for crop-type classification, which can benefit the achievement of sustainable development goals 2 (SDGs2)."

Time series classification (TSC) is very commonly used for modeling digital clinical measures. While deep learning models for TSC are very common and powerful, there exist some fundamental challenges. This review presents the non-deep learning models that are commonly used for time series classification in biomedical applications that can achieve high performance. Objective: We performed a systematic review to characterize the techniques that are used in time series classification of digital clinical measures throughout all the stages of data processing and model building. Methods: We conducted a literature search on PubMed, as well as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases using a range of search terms to retrieve peer-reviewed articles that report on the academic research about digital clinical measures from a five-year period between June 2016 and June 2021. We identified and categorized the research studies based on the types of classification algorithms and sensor input types. Results: We found 452 papers in total from four different databases: PubMed, IEEE, Web of Science Database, and SCOPUS. After removing duplicates and irrelevant papers, 135 articles remained for detailed review and data extraction. Among these, engineered features using time series methods that were subsequently fed into widely used machine learning classifiers were the most commonly used technique, and also most frequently achieved the best performance metrics (77 out of 135 articles). Statistical modeling (24 out of 135 articles) algorithms were the second most common and also the second-best classification technique. Conclusions: In this review paper, summaries of the time series classification models and interpretation methods for biomedical applications are summarized and categorized. While high time series classification performance has been achieved in digital clinical, physiological, or biomedical measures, no standard benchmark datasets, modeling methods, or reporting methodology exist. There is no single widely used method for time series model development or feature interpretation, however many different methods have proven successful."

Single timepoint imagery has limitations in this aspect due to a comparatively similar spectral signature of crops. Even in multi-time point imagery, the viability of optical datasets is thwarted by clouds in crop growing seasons. Hence, researchers have used the all-weather imaging capabilities of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for crop classification. This all-weather capability of SAR and the multispectral capability of Optical datasets combined with their time series data hold great potential in remote sensing-based crop classification. Nevertheless, the underlying patterns of the combined SAR and optical time series haven’t been meticulously explored, especially for socio-economically important crops like sugarcane. Therefore, this study proposes using the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series datasets and crop phenology information to develop a Neural Network capable of identifying sugarcane crops in the sugar belts of Western-Uttar Pradesh. Studies are done for the year 2020 using a Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network obtaining high accuracies in classifying sugarcane and non-sugarcane classes using optical and SAR time-series analysis datasets. The synthetic dataset has also been developed to enhance the convergence of the deep learning model, producing higher accuracy than utilizing the original dataset. Consequently, the study contributes to remote sensing-based crop classification and sets a foundation for further advancements in this domain."

Therefore, the full extraction of multiscale timing-dependence features is important for mining seasonal and phenological change laws and improving the accuracy of time-series land-cover classification. However, traditional methods are often unable to fully detect the global and local change information generated during the evolution of land covers, resulting in incomplete timing-dependence features being extracted and a low classification accuracy. The Informer network can fully capture the long-term dependence of a time series, thereby improving its classification accuracy. Therefore, we propose a high-accuracy land-cover classification method with the Informer network. First, we continuously shorten the length of the series so that the ProbSparse self-attention mechanism can consider timing dependencies on multiscale, and then we can obtain the features of the local important moments. Second, we calculate the correlation between the important moments and the other moments, as well as the correlation among each moment, to fully utilize the local and global time-dependent features of the land-cover time series. Third, we add a fully connected batch normalization module in order to use all the extracted timing dependence for classification. Finally, the proposed model is compared with traditional models on two datasets: for the reorganized BreizhCrops dataset, it achieved a performance similar to long short-term memory; for the TiSeLaC dataset, it achieved an F1-score of 96.011%, which is 0.33% higher than the second-best model."

This study proposes a novel approach for classifying different irrigation systems at field level by using remotely sensed data at subfield scale as inputs of different supervised machine learning (ML) models for time-series classification. The ML models were trained using ground-truth data from more than 300 fields collected during a field campaign in 2020 across an intensely cultivated region in Catalunya, Spain. Two hydrological variables retrieved from satellite data, actual evapotranspiration (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$ET_{a}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) and soil moisture (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$SM$</tex-math></inline-formula>), showed the best results when used for classification, especially when combined together, retrieving a final accuracy of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$90.1 \pm 2.7\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>. All the three ML models employed for the classification showed that they were able to distinguish different irrigation systems, regardless of the different crops present in each field. For all the different tests, the best performances were reached by ResNET, the only deep neural network model among the three tested. The resulting method enables the creation of maps of irrigation systems at field level and for large areas, delivering detailed information on the status and evolution of irrigation practices."

The output of the convolution operation on each time series is represented by a partial positive value (PPV). A concatenation of PPVs from all kernels is the input feature vector to a Ridge regression classifier. Unlike typical deep learning models, the kernels are not trained and there is no weighted/trainable connection between kernels or concatenated features and the classifier. Since these kernels are generated randomly, a portion of these kernels may not positively contribute in performance of the model. Hence, selection of the most important kernels and pruning the redundant and less important ones is necessary to reduce computational complexity and accelerate inference of Rocket for applications on the edge devices. Selection of these kernels is a combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a scheme for selecting these kernels while maintaining the classification performance. First, the original model is pre-trained at full capacity. Then, a population of binary candidate state vectors is initialized where each element of a vector represents the active/inactive status of a kernel. A population-based optimization algorithm evolves the population in order to find a best state vector which minimizes the number of active kernels while maximizing the accuracy of the classifier. This activation function is a linear combination of the total number of active kernels and the classification accuracy of the pre-trained classifier with the active kernels. Finally, the selected kernels in the best state vector are utilized to train the Ridge regression classifier with the selected kernels."

However, existing work on shapelets selection cannot be applied to multivariate time series classification (MTSC) since the candidate shapelets of MTSC may come from different variables of different lengths and thus cannot be directly compared. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel model called ShapeNet, which embeds shapelet candidates of different lengths into a unified space for shapelet selection. The network is trained using cluster-wise triplet loss, which considers the distance between anchor and multiple positive (negative) samples and the distance between positive (negative) samples, which are important for convergence. We compute representative and diversified final shapelets rather than directly using all the embeddings for model building to avoid a large fraction of non-discriminative shapelet candidates. We have conducted experiments on ShapeNet with competitive state-of-the-art and benchmark methods using UEA MTS datasets. The results show that the accuracy of ShapeNet is the best of all the methods compared. Furthermore, we illustrate the shapelets’ interpretability with two case studies."

However, speed and data reduction are equally important in many applications, especially when the data scale and storage requirements rapidly increase. Current multivariate time series classification (MTSC) algorithms need hundreds of compute hours to complete training and prediction. This is due to the nature of multivariate time series data which grows with the number of time series, their length and the number of channels. In many applications, not all the channels are useful for the classification task, hence we require methods that can efficiently select useful channels and thus save computational resources. We propose and evaluate two methods for channel selection. Our techniques work by representing each class by a prototype time series and performing channel selection based on the prototype distance between classes. The main hypothesis is that useful channels enable better separation between classes; hence, channels with a larger distance between class prototypes are more useful. On the UEA MTSC benchmark, we show that these techniques achieve significant data reduction and classifier speedup for similar levels of classification accuracy. Channel selection is applied as a pre-processing step before training state-of-the-art MTSC algorithms and saves about 70% of computation time and data storage with preserved accuracy. Furthermore, our methods enable efficient classifiers, such as ROCKET, to achieve better accuracy than using no selection or greedy forward channel selection. To further study the impact of our techniques, we present experiments on classifying synthetic multivariate time series datasets with more than 100 channels, as well as a real-world case study on a dataset with 50 channels. In both cases, our channel selection methods result in significant data reduction with preserved or improved accuracy."

RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) proved to be an outstanding algorithm capable to classify time series accurately and quickly. The textbook variant of the multivariate time series classification problem assumes that time series to be classified are all of the same length, while in real-world applications this assumption not necessarily holds. The literature of this domain does not pay enough attention to data processing pipelines for variable-length time series. Thus, in this paper, we present a thorough analysis of three preprocessing pipelines that handle variable-length time series that need to be classified with a method that requires the data to be of equal length. These three methods are truncation, padding, and forecasting of missing value. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, showed that the recommended procedure involves padding. Forecasting ensures similar classification accuracy, but comes at a much higher computational cost. Truncation is not a viable option. Furthermore, in the paper, we present a novel domain of application of multivariate time series classification algorithms, that is incident detection in cash transactions. This area poses substantive challenges for automated model training procedures since the data is not only variable-length, but also heavily imbalanced. In the study, we list various incident types and present trained classifiers capable to aid human auditors in their daily work."

For the state of Maharashtra, India, this is more than 80% for almost all regions of the state. The high variability of rainfall during this period necessitates the classification of rainy and non-rainy days. While there are various approaches to rainfall classification, this paper proposes rainfall classification based on weather variables. This paper explores the use of support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms for the binary classification of summer monsoon rainfall using common weather variables such as relative humidity, temperature, pressure. The daily data, for the summer monsoon months, for nineteen years, was collected for the Shivajinagar station of Pune in the state of Maharashtra, India. Classification accuracy of 82.1 and 82.8%, respectively, was achieved with SVM and ANN algorithms, for an imbalanced dataset. While performance parameters such as misclassification rate, F1 score indicate that better results were achieved with ANN, model parameter selection for SVM was less involved than ANN. Domain adaptation technique was used for rainfall classification at the other two stations of Maharashtra with the network trained for the Shivajinagar station. Satisfactory results for these two stations were obtained only after changing the training method for SVM and ANN."

EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components: a feature-based student–teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. For each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher’s hidden layers to its student’s hidden layers via knowledge distillation, where the teacher and student have identical network structures. For each connected user, its student model’s hidden layers’ weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance (LSD) used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user’s and its partner’s weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user’s and its partner’s weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers’ hidden layers. Experimental results show that compared with a number of state-of-the-art federated learning (FL) algorithms, our proposed EFDLS wins 20 out of 44 standard UCR2018 datasets and achieves the highest mean accuracy (70.14%) on these datasets. In particular, compared with a single-task baseline, EFDLS obtains 32/4/8 regarding “win”/“tie”/“lose” and results in an improvement of approximately 4% in terms of mean accuracy."

Thus, we propose a new concept: Continuous Classification of Time Series (CCTS). It requires the model to learn data in different time stages. But the time series evolves dynamically, leading to different data distributions. When a model learns multi-distribution, it always forgets or overfits. We suggest that meaningful learning scheduling is potential due to an interesting observation: Measured by confidence, the process of model learning multiple distributions is similar to the process of human learning multiple knowledge. Thus, we propose a novel Confidence-guided method for CCTS (C3TS). It can imitate the alternating human confidence described by the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We define the objective-confidence to arrange data, and the self-confidence to control the learning duration. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that C3TS is more accurate than all baselines for CCTS."

We often observe this effect in applications with complex observation processes, such as health care, climate science, and astronomy, to name a few. Because of the asynchronous nature, they pose a significant challenge to deep learning architectures, which presume that the time series presented to them are regularly sampled, fully observed, and aligned with respect to time. This paper proposes a novel framework, that we call Deep Convolutional Set Functions (DCSF), which is highly scalable and memory efficient, for the asynchronous time series classification task. With the recent advancements in deep set learning architectures, we introduce a model that is invariant to the order in which time series’ channels are presented to it. We explore convolutional neural networks, which are well researched for the closely related problem-classification of regularly sampled and fully observed time series, for encoding the set elements. We evaluate DCSF for AsTS classification, and online (per time point) AsTS classification. Our extensive experiments on multiple real world and synthetic datasets verify that the suggested model performs substantially better than a range of state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and run time. We increase the accuracy of the mini-Physionet dataset upto 2%; real datasets with synthetic setups of both AsTS, and TSMV upto 30%."

Deep learning approaches have been commonly employed for the SITS classification and have provided state-of-the-art performance. However, deep learning methods suffer from overfitting when labeled data are scarce. To address this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised pretraining scheme to initialize a transformer-based network by utilizing large-scale unlabeled data. In detail, the model is asked to predict randomly contaminated observations given an entire time series of a pixel. The main idea of our proposal is to leverage the inherent temporal structure of satellite time series to learn general-purpose spectral-temporal representations related to land cover semantics. Once pretraining is completed, the pretrained network can be further adapted to various SITS classification tasks by fine-tuning all the model parameters on small-scale task-related labeled data. In this way, the general knowledge and representations about SITS can be transferred to a label-scarce task, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model as well as reducing the risk of overfitting. Comprehensive experiments have been carried out on three benchmark datasets over large study areas. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pretraining scheme, leading to substantial improvements in classification accuracy using transformer, 1-D convolutional neural network, and bidirectional long short-term memory network. The code and the pretrained model will be available at https://github.com/linlei1214/SITS-BERT upon publication."

In particular, in the field of crop classification, time dimension information is particularly important. Although some advanced machine learning algorithms, such as random forests (RFs), can achieve good results, they often ignore the time series information. To make full use of temporal and spectral information in multitemporal remote sensing images, a channel attention-based temporal convolutional network (CA-TCN) is proposed in this letter. Specifically, the proposed method is composed of two main modules: temporal convolutional network and attention block. The temporal convolutional network can capture long-range dependence by using a hierarchy of temporal convolutional filters. To capture relevant information inside the sequence and enhance the important information, the attention block is used to enhance the important features in the channel dimension since not all bands contain equal information in crop type classification. The proposed CA-TCN can excavate deeper phenological characteristics. Compared to the temporal attention-based temporal convolutional network and other deep learning-based models, the proposed CA-TCN has achieved state-of-the-art performance in the Breizhcrops dataset with fewer parameters."

It gradually expanded, until 2015 when it increased in size from 45 datasets to 85 datasets. In October 2018 more datasets were added, bringing the total to 128. The new archive contains a wide range of problems, including variable length series, but it still only contains univariate time series classification problems. One of the motivations for introducing the archive was to encourage researchers to perform a more rigorous evaluation of newly proposed time series classification (TSC) algorithms. It has worked: most recent research into TSC uses all 85 datasets to evaluate algorithmic advances. Research into multivariate time series classification, where more than one series are associated with each class label, is in a position where univariate TSC research was a decade ago. Algorithms are evaluated using very few datasets and claims of improvement are not based on statistical comparisons. We aim to address this problem by forming the first iteration of the MTSC archive, to be hosted at the website this http URL. Like the univariate archive, this formulation was a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the University of California, Riverside (UCR). The 2018 vintage consists of 30 datasets with a wide range of cases, dimensions and series lengths. For this first iteration of the archive we format all data to be of equal length, include no series with missing data and provide train/test splits."

In theory, NCDEs exhibit better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended to adopt attention, methods to integrate attention into NCDEs have not yet been studied. To this end, we present attentive neural controlled differential equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments on 5 real-world time-series datasets and 11 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct experiments on irregular time-series. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial information."

This problem generalizes classic time series classification to ask if we can classify a time series subsequence with sufficient accuracy and confidence after seeing only some prefix of a target pattern. The idea is that the earlier classification would allow us to take immediate action, in a domain in which some practical interventions are possible. For example, that intervention might be sounding an alarm or applying the brakes in an automobile. In this work, we make a surprising claim. In spite of the fact that there are dozens of papers on early classification of time series, it is not clear that any of them could ever work in a real-world setting. The problem is not with the algorithms per se but with the vague and underspecified problem description. Essentially all algorithms make implicit and unwarranted assumptions about the problem that will ensure that they will be plagued by false positives and false negatives even if their results suggested that they could obtain near-perfect results. We will explain our findings with novel insights and experiments and offer recommendations to the community."

However, DNNs require large amounts of labeled data for supervised training. Although data augmentation can alleviate this problem, the standard approach assigns the same label to all augmented samples from the same source. This leads to the expansion of the data distribution such that the classification boundaries may be even harder to determine. In this paper, we propose Joint-label learning by Dual Augmentation (JobDA), which can enrich the training samples without expanding the distribution of the original data. Instead, we apply simple transformations to the time series and give these modified time series new labels, so that the model has to distinguish between these and the original data, as well as separating the original classes. This approach sharpens the boundaries around the original time series, and results in superior classification performance. We use Time Series Warping for our transformations: We shrink and stretch different regions of the original time series, like a fun-house mirror. Experiments conducted on extensive time-series datasets show that JobDA can improve the model performance on small datasets. Moreover, we verify that JobDA has better generalization ability compared with conventional data augmentation, and the visualization analysis further demonstrates that JobDA can learn more compact clusters."

The existing time series classification methods have the problems of low classification accuracy and low efficiency. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a T-CNN time series classification method based on a Gram matrix. Specifically, we perform wavelet threshold denoising on time series to filter normal curve noise, and propose a lossless transformation method based on the Gram matrix, which converts the time series to the time domain image and retains all the information of events. Then, we propose an improved CNN time series classification method, which introduces the Toeplitz convolution kernel matrix into convolution layer calculation. Finally, we introduce a Triplet network to calculate the similarity between similar events and different classes of events, and optimize the squared loss function of CNN. The proposed T-CNN model can accelerate the convergence rate of gradient descent and improve classification accuracy.

The key idea is to transform numerical time series to symbolic representations in the time or frequency domain, i.e., sequences of symbols, and then extract features from these sequences. While achieving high accuracy, existing symbolic classifiers are computationally expensive. It is also not clear whether further accuracy and speed improvements could be gained by a careful analysis of the symbolic transform and the trade-offs between time domain and frequency domain symbolic features. In this paper we present MrSQM, a new time series classifier that uses multiple symbolic representations and efficient sequence mining, to extract important time series features. We study two symbolic transforms and four feature selection approaches on symbolic sequences, ranging from fully supervised, to unsupervised and hybrids. We propose a new approach for optimal supervised symbolic feature selection in all-subsequence space, by adapting a Chi-squared bound developed for discriminative pattern mining, to time series. Our experiments on the 112 datasets of the UEA/UCR benchmark demonstrate that MrSQM can quickly extract useful features and learn accurate classifiers with the logistic regression algorithm. We show that a fast symbolic transform combined with a simple feature selection strategy can be highly effective as compared to more sophisticated and expensive feature selection methods. MrSQM completes training and prediction on 112 UEA/UCR datasets in 1.5h for an accuracy comparable to existing efficient state-of-the-art methods, e.g., MrSEQL (10h) and ROCKET (2.5h). Furthermore, MrSQM enables the user to trade-off accuracy and speed by controlling the type and number of symbolic representations, thus further reducing the total runtime to 20 minutes for a similar level of accuracy.

Considering that automatic predictions in these domains might have a substantial impact on the well-being of a person, as well as considerable financial and legal consequences to an individual or a company, all actions and decisions that result from applying these models have to be accountable. Given that a substantial amount of data that is collected in high-stake domains are in the form of time series, in this paper we examine the current state of eXplainable AI (XAI) methods with a focus on approaches for opening up deep learning black boxes for the task of time series classification. Finally, our contribution also aims at deriving promising directions for future work, to advance XAI for deep learning on time series data."

The language of music has vast diversity. For centuries, people have indulged in debates to stratisfy between Western and Indian Classical Music. But through this paper, an understanding can be fabricated while differentiating the types of Indian Classical Music. Classical music is one of the essential characteristics of Indian Cultural Heritage. Indian Classical Music is divided into two major parts, i.e. Hindustani and Carnatic. Models have been sculptured and trained to classify between Hindustani and Carnatic Music. In this paper, two approaches are used to implement classification models. MFCCs are used as features and implemented models like DNN (1 Layer, 2 Layers, 3 Layers), CNN (1 Layer, 2 Layers, 3 Layers), RNN-LSTM, SVM (Sigmoid, Polynomial & Gaussian Kernel) as one approach. A 3 channels input is created by merging features like MFCC, Spectrogram and Scalogram and implemented models like VGG-16, CNN (1 Layer, 2 Layers, 3 Layers), ResNet-50 as another approach. 3 Layered CNN and RNN-LSTM model performed best among all the approaches."

In this work, we investigate the transferability of state-of-the-art deep semi-supervised models from image to time series classification. We discuss the necessary model adaptations, in particular an appropriate model backbone architecture and the use of tailored data augmentation strategies. Based on these adaptations, we explore the potential of deep semi-supervised learning in the context of time series classification by evaluating our methods on large public time series classification problems with varying amounts of labeled samples. We perform extensive comparisons under a decidedly realistic and appropriate evaluation scheme with a unified reimplementation of all algorithms considered, which is yet lacking in the field.

TSViT splits a SITS record into non-overlapping patches in space and time which are tokenized and subsequently processed by a factorized temporo-spatial encoder. We argue, that in contrast to natural images, a temporal-then-spatial factorization is more intuitive for SITS processing and present experimental evidence for this claim. Additionally, we enhance the model's discriminative power by introducing two novel mechanisms for acquisition-time-specific temporal positional encodings and multiple learnable class tokens. The effect of all novel design choices is evaluated through an extensive ablation study. Our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous approaches by a significant margin in three publicly available SITS semantic segmentation and classification datasets.

Here, we explore the deep-learning approach in order to build a solar flare-forecasting model, while examining its limitations and feature-extraction ability based on the available Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-ray time-series data. We present a multilayer 1D convolutional neural network to forecast the solar flare event probability occurrence of M- and X-class flares at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr time frames. The forecasting models were trained and evaluated in two different scenarios: (1) random selection and (2) chronological selection, which were compared afterward in terms of common score metrics. Additionally, we also compared our results to state-of-the-art flare-forecasting models. The results indicates that (1) when X-ray time-series data are used alone, the suggested model achieves higher score results for X-class flares and similar scores for M-class as in previous studies. (2) The two different scenarios obtain opposite results for the X- and M-class flares. (3) The suggested model combined with solely X-ray time-series fails to distinguish between M- and X-class magnitude solar flare events. Furthermore, based on the suggested method, the achieved scores, obtained solely from X-ray time-series measurements, indicate that substantial information regarding the solar activity and physical processes are encapsulated in the data, and augmenting additional data sets, both spatial and temporal, may lead to better predictions, while gaining a comprehensive physical interpretation regarding solar activity.

 Future surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will observe an order of magnitude more astrophysical transient events than any previous survey before. With this deluge of photometric data, it will be impossible for all such events to be classified by humans alone. Recent efforts have sought to leverage machine learning methods to tackle the challenge of astronomical transient classification, with ever improving success. Transformers are a recently developed deep learning architecture, first proposed for natural language processing, that have shown a great deal of recent success. In this work we develop a new transformer architecture, which uses multi-head self attention at its core, for general multi-variate time-series data. Furthermore, the proposed time-series transformer architecture supports the inclusion of an arbitrary number of additional features, while also offering interpretability. We apply the time-series transformer to the task of photometric classification, minimising the reliance of expert domain knowledge for feature selection, while achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art photometric classification methods. We achieve a logarithmic-loss of 0.507 on imbalanced data in a representative setting using data from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC). Moreover, we achieve a micro-averaged receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.98 and micro-averaged precision-recall area under curve of 0.87."

However, conventional time-series classification algorithms fail to tackle the few-shot scenario. Existing few-shot learning methods are proposed to tackle image or text data, and most of them are neural-based models that lack interpretability. This paper proposes an interpretable neural-based framework, namely Dual Prototypical Shapelet Networks (DPSN) for few-shot time-series classification, which not only trains a neural network-based model but also interprets the model from dual granularity: 1) global overview using representative time series samples, and 2) local highlights using discriminative shapelets. In particular, the generated dual prototypical shapelets consist of representative samples that can mostly demonstrate the overall shapes of all samples in the class and discriminative partial-length shapelets that can be used to distinguish different classes. We have derived 18 few-shot TSC datasets from public benchmark datasets and evaluated the proposed method by comparing with baselines. The DPSN framework outperforms state-of-the-art time-series classification methods, especially when training with limited amounts of data. Several case studies have been given to demonstrate the interpret ability of our model."

However, it still remains a challenge for estuarine and coastal regions due to the lack of appropriate approaches to consistently generate accurate and long-term LULC maps. In this work, an object-based classification framework was designed to mapping annual LULC changes in the Yangtze River estuary region from 1985–2016 using Landsat time series data. Characteristics of the inter-annual changes of LULC was then analyzed. The results showed that the object-based classification framework could accurately produce annual time series of LULC maps with overall accuracies over 86% for all single-year classifications. Results also indicated that the annual LULC maps enabled the clear depiction of the long-term variability of LULC and could be used to monitor the gradual changes that would not be observed using bi-temporal or sparse time series maps. Specifically, the impervious area rapidly increased from 6.42% to 22.55% of the total land area from 1985 to 2016, whereas the cropland area dramatically decreased from 80.61% to 55.44%. In contrast to the area of forest and grassland, which almost tripled, the area of inland water remained consistent from 1985 to 2008 and slightly increased from 2008 to 2016. However, the area of coastal marshes and barren tidal flats varied with large fluctuations."

The particularity of the data makes it a challenging task and different approaches have been taken, including the distance based approach. 1-NN has been a widely used method within distance based time series classification due to its simplicity but still good performance. However, its supremacy may be attributed to being able to use specific distances for time series within the classification process and not to the classifier itself. With the aim of exploiting these distances within more complex classifiers, new approaches have arisen in the past few years that are competitive or which outperform the 1-NN based approaches. In some cases, these new methods use the distance measure to transform the series into feature vectors, bridging the gap between time series and traditional classifiers. In other cases, the distances are employed to obtain a time series kernel and enable the use of kernel methods for time series classification. One of the main challenges is that a kernel function must be positive semi-definite, a matter that is also addressed within this review.

This goal has barely been addressed in the literature. F4 consists of two steps. First, a set of features based on the quantile cross-spectral density and the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform are extracted from each series. Second, a random forest is fed with the extracted features. An extensive simulation study shows that F4 outperforms some powerful classifiers in a wide variety of situations, including stationary and nonstationary series. The proposed method is also capable of successfully discriminating between electrocardiogram (ECG) signals of healthy subjects and those with myocardial infarction condition. Additionally, despite lacking shape-based information, F4 attains state-of-the-art results in some datasets of the University of East Anglia (UEA) multivariate time series classification archive."

We propose several model variants, evaluate them alongside other published models using the Opportunity benchmark dataset, demonstrate the effect of model ensembling and of altering key parameters, and quantify the quality of the models’ segmentation of discrete events. We also offer recommendations for use and suggest potential model extensions.

1ba63a5c94b42fcf7320e8ef2cc52cc14752dab6,Early Classification of Time Series: Cost-based multiclass Algorithms,Paul-Emile Zafar; Youssef Achenchabe; A. Bondu; A. Cornuéjols; V. Lemaire,2021.0,4,[],"Early classification of time series assigns each time series to one of a set of pre-defined classes using as few measurements as possible while preserving a high accuracy. This implies solving online the trade-off between the earliness and the prediction accuracy. This has been formalized in previous work where a cost-based framework taking into account both the cost of misclassification and the cost of delaying the decision has been proposed. The best resulting method, called Economy-$\gamma$, is unfortunately so far limited to binary classification problems. This paper presents a set of six new methods that extend the Economy-$\gamma$ method in order to solve multiclass classification problems. Extensive experiments on 33 datasets allowed us to compare the performance of the six proposed approaches to the state-of-the-art one. The results show that: (i) all proposed methods perform significantly better than the state of the art one; (ii) the best way to extend Economy-$\gamma$ to multiclass problems is to use a confidence score, either the Gini index or the maximum probability."

The sensors generate multiple streams of measurements, called as multivariate time series, corresponding to an operation of the appliance. An appliance can go through various types of faults during its lifetime. Such a fault can be identified by classifying the multivariate time series (MTS), which is generated by the sensors corresponding to this fault. As it is also unfeasible to have prior knowledge about all types of faults, the classification approach should also be able to identify an unseen (unknown) fault using its MTS. In this article, we propose a semantic-information-based early classification approach for MTS. The approach uses a concept of zero-shot learning to classify an unseen fault. This work conducts a case study to evaluate the approach by classifying different faults of a washing machine using sensory data."

To train an automatic diagnosis system with high accuracy and strong robustness in healthcare, sufficient training data are required when using deep learning-based methods. However, given that the data collected by sensors that are embedded in medical or mobile devices are inadequate, it is challenging to train an effective and efficient classification model with state-of-the-art performance. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose TS-GAN, a Time-series GAN architecture based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for sensor-based health data augmentation, thereby improving the performance of deep learning-based classification models. TS-GAN aims to learn a generative model that creates time-series data with the same space and time dependence as the real data. Specifically, we design an LSTM-based generator for creating realistic data and an LSTM-based discriminator for determining how similar the generated data are to real data. In particular, we design a sequential-squeeze-and-excitation module in the LSTM-based discriminator to better understand space dependence of real data, and apply the gradient penalty originated from Wasserstein GANs in the training process to stabilize the optimization. We conduct comparative experiments to evaluate the performance of TS-GAN with TimeGAN, C-RNN-GAN and Conditional Wasserstein GANs through discriminator loss, maximum mean discrepancy, visualization methods and classification accuracy on health datasets of ECG_200, NonInvasiveFatalECG_Thorax1, and mHealth, respectively. The experimental results show that TS-GAN exceeds other state-of-the-art time-series GANs in almost all the evaluation metrics, and the classifier trained on synthetic datasets generated by TS-GAN achieves the highest classification accuracy of 97.50% on ECG_200, 94.12% on NonInvasiveFatalECG_Thorax1, and 98.12% on mHealth, respectively."

Prior research has mostly focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of classifiers, with interpretability being somewhat neglected. This aspect of classifiers has become critical for many application domains and the introduction of the EU GDPR legislation in 2018 is likely to further emphasize the importance of interpretable learning algorithms. Currently, state-of-the-art classification accuracy is achieved with very complex models based on large ensembles (COTE) or deep neural networks (FCN). These approaches are not efficient with regard to either time or space, are difficult to interpret and cannot be applied to variable-length time series, requiring pre-processing of the original series to a set fixed-length. In this paper we propose new time series classification algorithms to address these gaps. Our approach is based on symbolic representations of time series, efficient sequence mining algorithms and linear classification models. Our linear models are as accurate as deep learning models but are more efficient regarding running time and memory, can work with variable-length time series and can be interpreted by highlighting the discriminative symbolic features on the original time series. We advance the state-of-the-art in time series classification by proposing new algorithms built using the following three key ideas: (1) Multiple resolutions of symbolic representations: we combine symbolic representations obtained using different parameters, rather than one fixed representation (e.g., multiple SAX representations); (2) Multiple domain representations: we combine symbolic representations in time (e.g., SAX) and frequency (e.g., SFA) domains, to be more robust across problem types; (3) Efficient navigation in a huge symbolic-words space: we extend a symbolic sequence classifier (SEQL) to work with multiple symbolic representations and use its greedy feature selection strategy to effectively filter the best features for each representation. We show that our multi-resolution multi-domain linear classifier (mtSS-SEQL+LR) achieves a similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art COTE ensemble, and to recent deep learning methods (FCN, ResNet), but uses a fraction of the time and memory required by either COTE or deep models. To further analyse the interpretability of our classifier, we present a case study on a human motion dataset collected by the authors. We discuss the accuracy, efficiency and interpretability of our proposed algorithms and release all the results, source code and data to encourage reproducibility."

image time series (SITS)
classification is a major research topic in remote sensing and is relevant for
a wide range of applications. Deep learning approaches have been commonly employed
for SITS classification and have provided state-of-the-art performance. However,
deep learning methods suffer from overfitting when labeled data is scarce. To address
this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training scheme to initialize
a Transformer-based network by utilizing large-scale unlabeled data. In detail,
the model is asked to predict randomly contaminated observations given an
entire time series of a pixel. The main idea of our proposal is to leverage the
inherent temporal structure of satellite time series to learn general-purpose
spectral-temporal representations related to land cover semantics. Once
pre-training is completed, the pre-trained network can be further adapted to various
SITS classification tasks by fine-tuning all the model parameters on small-scale
task-related labeled data. In this way, the general knowledge and
representations about SITS can be transferred to a label-scarce task, thereby
improving the generalization performance of the model as well as reducing the
risk of overfitting. Comprehensive experiments have been carried out on three
benchmark datasets over large study areas. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to a classification accuracy
increment up to 2.38% to 5.27%. The code and the pre-trained model will be
available at https://github.com/linlei1214/SITS-BERT upon publication.This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible."

And the rice paddy, an important artificial wetland type, plays an important role in the regional ecological environment. This study proposes a stacked generalization and spectral mixture approach to map paddy rice using coarse spatial resolution images [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectralradiometer, (MODIS)]. By this method, the time series MODIS enhanced vegetation index images, phenological variables, land surface water index, elevation, and slope images are all employed to produce the optimal feature combination, which is then used to map paddy rice by the stacking algorithm. The validation experiment using the data of the Dongting Lake area showed that the proposed method can improve the overall accuracy of single classifiers, including the support vector machine, random forest, k-nearestneigbor (kNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and decision tree. Stacking (XGB) achieves the highest overall accuracy (90.3%) and Kappa coefficient (0.86), which are 2.8% and 0.03 higher than that of using the single kNN classifier. Furthermore, its user accuracies for distinguishing double-cropping rice and single-season rice are 92.5% and 90.0%, respectively. In terms of the paddy rice classification accuracy, the stacking model is also superior to single classifiers. Moreover, the MODIS-derived rice map obtained by the stacked generalization approach and the spectral mixture method area has a large determination coefficient (R2 = 0.9975) with the government statistic data. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in using coarse spatial resolution images for large-scale paddy rice mapping."

In this paper, we put forward a new optimization criterion which takes into account both the cost of misclassification and the cost of delaying the decision. Based on this optimization criterion, we derived a family of non-myopic algorithms which try to anticipate the expected future gain in information in balance with the cost of waiting. In one class of algorithms, unsupervised-based, the expectations use the clustering of time series, while in a second class, supervised-based, time series are grouped according to the confidence level of the classifier used to label them. Extensive experiments carried out on real datasets using a large range of delay cost functions show that the presented algorithms are able to solve the earliness vs. accuracy trade-off, with the supervised partition based approaches faring better than the unsupervised partition based ones. In addition, all these methods perform better in a wide variety of conditions than a state of the art method based on a myopic strategy which is recognized as being very competitive.

Flat-COTE is an ensemble that combines 35 classifiers over four data representations. However, while comprehensive, the evaluation did not consider deep learning approaches. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have seen a surge in popularity and are now state of the art in many fields and raises the question of whether CNNs could be equally transformative for TSC. We implement a benchmark CNN for TSC using a common structure and use results from a TSC-specific CNN from the literature. We compare both to Flat-COTE and find that the collective is significantly more accurate than both CNNs. These results are impressive, but Flat-COTE is not without deficiencies. We significantly improve the collective by proposing a new hierarchical structure with probabilistic voting, defining and including two novel ensemble classifiers built in existing feature spaces, and adding further modules to represent two additional transformation domains. The resulting classifier, the Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (HIVE-COTE), encapsulates classifiers built on five data representations. We demonstrate that HIVE-COTE is significantly more accurate than Flat-COTE (and all other TSC algorithms that we are aware of) over 100 resamples of 85 TSC problems and is the new state of the art for TSC. Further analysis is included through the introduction and evaluation of 3 new case studies and extensive experimentation on 1,000 simulated datasets of 5 different types."

Recent years have witnessed the great success of deep learning methods, eg., CNN and RNN, in time series classification and forecasting, but heterogeneity as the very nature of time series has not yet been addressed adequately and remains the performance ""treadstone."" In this light, we argue that the intra-sequence non-stationarity and inter-sequence asynchronism are two types of heterogeneities widely existed in multiple times series, and propose a hybrid attention network called WHEN as deep learning solution. WHEN features in two attention mechanisms in two different modules. In the WaveAtt module, we propose a novel data-dependent wavelet function and integrate it into the BiLSTM network as the wavelet attention, for the purpose of analyzing dynamic frequency components in nonstationary time series. In the DTWAtt module, we transform the dynamic time warping (DTW) technique into the form as the DTW attention, where all input sequences are synchronized with a universal parameter sequence to overcome the time distortion problem in multiple time series. WHEN with the hybrid attentions is then formulated as task-dependent neural network for either classification or forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments on 30 UEA datasets and 3 real-world datasets with rich competitive baselines demonstrate the excellent performance of our model. The ability of WHEN in dealing with time series heterogeneities is also elaborately explored via specially designed analysis."

In this paper, we propose ConvTimeNet (CTN): an off-the-shelf deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on diverse univariate time series classification (TSC) source tasks. Once trained, CTN can be easily adapted to new TSC target tasks via a small amount of fine-tuning using labeled instances from the target tasks. We note that the length of convolutional filters is a key aspect when building a pre-trained model that can generalize to time series of different lengths across datasets. To achieve this, we incorporate filters of multiple lengths in all convolutional layers of CTN to capture temporal features at multiple time scales. We consider all 65 datasets with time series of lengths up to 512 points from the UCR TSC Benchmark for training and testing transferability of CTN: We train CTN on a randomly chosen subset of 24 datasets using a multi-head approach with a different softmax layer for each training dataset, and study generalizability and transferability of the learned filters on the remaining 41 TSC datasets. We observe significant gains in classification accuracy as well as computational efficiency when using pre-trained CTN as a starting point for subsequent task-specific fine-tuning compared to existing state-of-the-art TSC approaches. We also provide qualitative insights into the working of CTN by: i) analyzing the activations and filters of first convolution layer suggesting the filters in CTN are generically useful, ii) analyzing the impact of the design decision to incorporate multiple length decisions, and iii) finding regions of time series that affect the final classification decision via occlusion sensitivity analysis."

However, the existing workflow of producing land cover maps is very complicated and the result accuracy is ambiguous. This work builds a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) model to take advantage of the temporal pattern of crops across image time series to improve the accuracy and reduce the complexity. An end-to-end framework is proposed to train and test the model. Landsat scenes are used as Earth observations, and some field-measured data together with CDL (Cropland Data Layer) datasets are used as reference data. The network is thoroughly trained using state-of-the-art techniques of deep learning. Finally, we tested the network on multiple Landsat scenes to produce five-class and all-class land cover maps. The maps are visualized and compared with ground truth, CDL, and the results of SegNet CNN (convolutional neural network). The results show a satisfactory overall accuracy (> 97% for five-class and > 88% for all-class) and validate the feasibility of the proposed method. This study paves a promising way for using LSTM RNN in the classification of remote sensing image time series."

To date, fine, reliable and timely land cover information is scarce in Madagascar. However, mapping high-resolution land cover map in the tropics has been challenging due to limitations associated with heterogeneous landscapes, the volume of satellite data used, and the design of methodology. In this study, we proposed an automatic approach in which the tile-based model was used on each tile (defining an extent of 1° × 1° as a tile) for mapping land cover in Madagascar. We combined spectral-temporal, textural and topographical features derived from all available Sentinel-2 observations (i.e., 11,083 images) on Google Earth Engine (GEE). We generated a 10-m land cover map for Madagascar, with an overall accuracy of 89.2% based on independent validation samples obtained from a field survey and visual interpretation of very high-resolution (0.5–5 m) images. Compared with the conventional approach (i.e., the overall model used in the entire study area), our method enables reduce the misclassifications between several land cover types, including impervious land, grassland and wetland. The proposed approach demonstrates a great potential for mapping land cover in other tropical or subtropical regions."

Shape-based techniques use the raw numeric time series with Euclidean or Dynamic Time Warping distance and a 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier. They are accurate, but computationally intensive. Structure-based methods discretize the raw data into symbolic representations, then extract features for classifiers. Recent symbolic methods have outperformed numeric ones regarding both accuracy and efficiency. Most approaches employ a bag-of-symbolic-words representation, but typically the word-length is fixed across all time series, an issue identified as a major weakness in the literature. Also, there are no prior attempts to use efficient sequence learning techniques to go beyond single words, to features based on variable-length sequences of words or symbols. We study an efficient linear classification approach, SEQL, originally designed for classification of symbolic sequences. SEQL learns discriminative subsequences from training data by exploiting the all-subsequence space using greedy gradient descent. We explore different discretization approaches, from none at all to increasing smoothing of the original data, and study the effect of these transformations on the accuracy of SEQL classifiers. We propose two adaptations of SEQL for time series data, SAX-VSEQL, can deal with X-axis offsets by learning variable-length symbolic words, and SAX-VFSEQL, can deal with X-axis and Y-axis offsets, by learning fuzzy variable-length symbolic words. Our models are linear classifiers in rich feature spaces. Their predictions are based on the most discriminative subsequences learned during training, and can be investigated for interpreting the classification decision."

We propose a hierarchical attention-based temporal convolutional network (HA-TCN) for myotonic dystrohpy diagnosis from handgrip time series data, and introduce mechanisms that enable model explainability. We compare the performance of the HA-TCN model against that of benchmark TCN models, LSTM models with and without attention mechanisms, and SVM approaches with handcrafted features. In terms of classification accuracy and F1 score, we found all deep learning models have similar levels of performance, and they all outperform SVM. Further, the HA-TCN model outperforms its TCN counterpart with regards to computational efficiency regardless of network depth, and in terms of performance particularly when the number of hidden layers is small. Lastly, HA-TCN models can consistently identify relevant time series segments in the relaxation phase of the handgrip time series, and exhibit increased robustness to noise when compared to attention-based LSTM models."

This paper simultaneously explores both issues with deep convolution neural networks (CNNs). Because standard networks treat the majority and minority classes with same class weights, most CNN-based networks fail to classify imbalanced time series. Until recently, there is very little work applying deep learning to imbalanced time series classification (ITSC). Thus, we propose an adaptive cost-sensitive learning strategy to address the ITSC problem. The standard CNN is modified to a cost-sensitive network (CS-CNN), which is able to punish the misclassified samples using a class-dependent cost matrix. Moreover, this cost matrix is automatically updated based on overall class distribution and the CS-CNN’s training performance. The proposed method is extended to FCN, LSTM-FCN and ResNet. It is experimentally tested on five public benchmark UCR datasets and a real-life large volume dataset. Four cost-sensitive CNN-based networks are compared with several data samplers and two traditional ITSC methods. The modified networks are superior in all metrics. Results show that cost-sensitive networks successfully complete the ITSC tasks."
839c00e4ddcc769c19f34e0e99701b97a3e2e882,Permutation entropy: Influence of amplitude information on time series classification performance.,D. Cuesta-Frau,2019.0,27,[],"Permutation Entropy (PE) is a very popular complexity analysis tool for time series. De-spite its simplicity, it is very robust and yields goods results in applications related to assessing the randomness of a sequence, or as a quantitative feature for signal classification. It is based on com-puting the Shannon entropy of the relative frequency of all the ordinal patterns found in a time series. However, there is a basic consensus on the fact that only analysing sample order and not amplitude might have a detrimental effect on the performance of PE. As a consequence, a number of methods based on PE have been proposed in the last years to include the possible influence of sample ampli-tude. These methods claim to outperform PE but there is no general comparative analysis that confirms such claims independently. Furthermore, other statistics such as Sample Entropy (SampEn) are based solely on amplitude, and it could be argued that other tools like this one are better suited to exploit the amplitude differences than PE. The present study quantifies the performance of the standard PE method and other amplitude-included PE methods using a disparity of time series to find out if there are really significant performance differences. In addition, the study compares statistics based uniquely on ordinal or amplitude patterns. The objective was to ascertain whether the whole was more than the sum of its parts. The results confirmed that highest classification accuracy was achieved using both types of patterns simultaneously, instead of using standard PE (ordinal patterns), or SampEn (ampli-tude patterns) isolatedly."

To overcome these constraints, we analyzed and optimized the performance of a combined Random Forest (RF) classifier/object-based approach and applied it to multisource satellite data to produce land use maps of a smallholder agricultural zone in Madagascar at five different nomenclature levels. The RF classifier was first optimized by reducing the number of input variables. Experiments were then carried out to (i) test cropland masking prior to the classification of more detailed nomenclature levels, (ii) analyze the importance of each data source (a high spatial resolution (HSR) time series, a very high spatial resolution (VHSR) coverage and a digital elevation model (DEM)) and data type (spectral, textural or other), and (iii) quantify their contributions to classification accuracy levels. The results show that RF classifier optimization allowed for a reduction in the number of variables by 1.5- to 6-fold (depending on the classification level) and thus a reduction in the data processing time. Classification results were improved via the hierarchical approach at all classification levels, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.7% and 64.4% for the cropland and crop subclass levels, respectively. Spectral variables derived from an HSR time series were shown to be the most discriminating, with a better score for spectral indices over the reflectances. VHSR data were only found to be essential when implementing the segmentation of the area into objects and not for the spectral or textural features they can provide during classification."

Although shapelet-based methods have achieved good performance and interpretability, they still have two issues that can be improved. First, previous methods only assess a shapelet by how accurately it can classify all the samples. However, for multi-class imbalanced classification tasks, these methods will ignore the shapelets that can distinguish minority class from other classes and will tend to use the shapelets that are useful for discriminating the majority classes. Second, the shapelets are fixed after the training phase and cannot adapt to time series with deformations, which will lead to poor matches to the shapelets. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end shapelet learning model called Triple Shapelet Networks (TSNs) to extract multi-level feature representations. Specifically, TSN learns the most discriminative shapelets by gradient descent similar to previous methods. In addition, it learns category-specific shapelets for each class by using auxiliary binary classifiers. Finally, it uses a shapelet generator to produce sample-specific shapelets conditioned on subsequences of the input time series. The addition of category-level and sample-level shapelets to the standard model improves the performance. Experiments conducted on extensive time series data sets show that TSN is state-of-the-art compared to existing shapelet-based methods, and the visualization analysis also shows its effectiveness."

Minority samples would bring troubles for temporal deep learning classifiers due to the equal treatments of majority and minority class. Until recently, there were few works applying deep learning on imbalanced time-series classification (ITSC) tasks. Here, this paper aimed at tackling ITSC problems with deep learning. An adaptive cost-sensitive learning strategy was proposed to modify temporal deep learning models. Through the proposed strategy, classifiers could automatically assign misclassification penalties to each class. In the experimental section, the proposed method was utilized to modify five neural networks. They were evaluated on a large volume, real-life and imbalanced time-series dataset with six metrics. Each single network was also tested alone and combined with several mainstream data samplers. Experimental results illustrated that the proposed cost-sensitive modified networks worked well on ITSC tasks. Compared to other methods, the cost-sensitive convolution neural network and residual network won out in the terms of all metrics. Consequently, the proposed cost-sensitive learning strategy can be used to modify deep learning classifiers from cost-insensitive to cost-sensitive.

Optical remote sensing has been a key technique for acquiring crop area and conditions on regional to global scales, but great challenges arise due to frequent cloudy days in southern China. This makes optical remote sensing images usually unavailable. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) could bridge this gap since it is less affected by clouds. The recent availability of Sentinel-1A (S1A) SAR imagery with a 12-day revisit period at a high spatial resolution of about 10 m makes it possible to fully utilize phenological information to improve early crop classification. In deep learning methods, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs), long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM RNNs), and gated recurrent unit RNNs (GRU RNNs) have been shown to efficiently extract temporal features for classification tasks. However, due to the complexity of training, these three deep learning methods have been less used in early crop classification. In this work, we attempted to combine them with an incremental classification method to avoid the need for training optimal architectures and hyper-parameters for data from each time series. First, we trained 1D CNNs, LSTM RNNs, and GRU RNNs based on the full images’ time series to attain three classifiers with optimal architectures and hyper-parameters. Then, starting at the first time point, we performed an incremental classification process to train each classifier using all of the previous data, and obtained a classification network with all parameter values (including the hyper-parameters) at each time point. Finally, test accuracies of each time point were assessed for each crop type to determine the optimal time series length. A case study was conducted in Suixi and Leizhou counties of Zhanjiang City, China. To verify the effectiveness of this method, we also implemented the classic random forest (RF) approach. The results were as follows: (i) 1D CNNs achieved the highest Kappa coefficient (0.942) of the four classifiers, and the highest value (0.934) in the GRU RNNs time series was attained earlier than with other classifiers; (ii) all three deep learning methods and the RF achieved F measures above 0.900 before the end of growth seasons of banana, eucalyptus, second-season paddy rice, and sugarcane; while, the 1D CNN classifier was the only one that could obtain an F-measure above 0.900 for pineapple before harvest. All results indicated the effectiveness of the solution combining the deep learning models with the incremental classification approach for early crop classification. This method is expected to provide new perspectives for early mapping of croplands in cloudy areas.

The recent development of Earth observation systems – like the Copernicus Sentinels – has provided access to satellite data with high spatial and temporal resolution. This is a key component for the accurate monitoring of state and changes in land use and land cover. In this research, the crops classification was performed by implementing two deep neural networks based on structured data. Despite the wide availability of optical satellite imagery, such as Landsat and Sentinel-2, the limitations of high quality tagged data make the training of machine learning methods very difficult. For this purpose, we have created and labeled a dataset of the crops in Slovenia for the year 2017. With the selected methods we are able to correctly classify 87% of all cultures. Similar studies have already been carried out in the past, but are limited to smaller regions or a smaller number of crop types.

The training samples in this setting are assumed to be normal. In more practical situations, it is difficult to guarantee that all samples are normal. Meanwhile, preparing a completely clean training dataset is costly and laborious. Such a case may degrade the performance of OCC-based anomaly detection methods which fit the training distribution as the normal distribution. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose MTGFlow, an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for Multivariate Time series anomaly detection via dynamic Graph and entity-aware normalizing Flow. MTGFlow first estimates the density of the entire training samples and then identifies anomalous instances based on the density of the test samples within the fitted distribution. This relies on a widely accepted assumption that anomalous instances exhibit more sparse densities than normal ones, with no reliance on the clean training dataset. However, it is intractable to directly estimate the density due to the complex dependencies among entities and their diverse inherent characteristics, not to mention detecting anomalies based on the estimated distribution. In order to address these problems, we utilize the graph structure learning model to learn interdependent and evolving relations among entities, which effectively captures the complex and accurate distribution patterns of multivariate time series. In addition, our approach incorporates the unique characteristics of individual entities by employing an entity-aware normalizing flow. This enables us to represent each entity as a parameterized normal distribution. Furthermore, considering that some entities present similar characteristics, we propose a cluster strategy that capitalizes on the commonalities of entities with similar characteristics, resulting in more precise and detailed density estimation. We refer to this cluster-aware extension as MTGFlow_cluster.

To address this, we propose T-Rep, a self-supervised method to learn time series representations at a timestep granularity. T-Rep learns vector embeddings of time alongside its feature extractor, to extract temporal features such as trend, periodicity, or distribution shifts from the signal. These time-embeddings are leveraged in pretext tasks, to incorporate smooth and fine-grained temporal dependencies in the representations, as well as reinforce robustness to missing data. We evaluate T-Rep on downstream classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks. It is compared to existing self-supervised algorithms for time series, which it outperforms in all three tasks. We test T-Rep in missing data regimes, where it proves more resilient than its counterparts. Finally, we provide latent space visualisation experiments, highlighting the interpretability of the learned representations."

Designers often look for tools to help classify and categorize the data. Traditional machine learning techniques for time-series data offer several solutions to solve these problems; however, the artifacts trained by these algorithms often lack interpretability. On the other hand, temporal logic, such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) have been successfully used in the formal methods community as specifications of time-series behaviors. In this work, we propose a new technique to automatically learn temporal logic formulas that are able to classify real-valued time-series data. Previous work on learning STL formulas from data either assumes a formula-template to be given by the user, or assumes some special fragment of STL that enables exploring the formula structure in a systematic fashion. In our technique, we relax these assumptions, and provide a way to systematically explore the space of all STL formulas. As the space of all STL formulas is very large, and contains many semantically equivalent formulas, we suggest a technique to heuristically prune the space of formulas considered. Finally, we illustrate our technique on various case studies from the automotive and transportation domains."

In contrast to NLP and CV, where a single model can handle various tasks, time series analysis still relies heavily on task-specific methods for activities such as classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and few-shot learning. The primary obstacle to developing a pre-trained model for time series analysis is the scarcity of sufficient training data. In our research, we overcome this obstacle by utilizing pre-trained models from language or CV, which have been trained on billions of data points, and apply them to time series analysis. We assess the effectiveness of the pre-trained transformer model in two ways. Initially, we maintain the original structure of the self-attention and feedforward layers in the residual blocks of the pre-trained language or image model, using the Frozen Pre-trained Transformer (FPT) for time series analysis with the addition of projection matrices for input and output. Additionally, we introduce four unique adapters, designed specifically for downstream tasks based on the pre-trained model, including forecasting and anomaly detection. These adapters are further enhanced with efficient parameter tuning, resulting in superior performance compared to all state-of-the-art methods. Our comprehensive experimental studies reveal that (a) the simple FPT achieves top-tier performance across various time series analysis tasks; and (b) fine-tuning the FPT with the custom-designed adapters can further elevate its performance, outshining specialized task-specific models. As presented in Figure 1, pre-trained models from natural language domains demonstrate remarkable performance, outstripping competitors in all key time series analysis tasks. Furthermore, both theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the self-attention module behaves analogously to principle component analysis (PCA). This insight is instrumental in understanding how the transformer bridges the domain gap and is a vital step toward grasping the universality of a pre-trained transformer.

NPF can be directly observed by monitoring the time-evolution of ambient aerosol particle size distributions. From the measured distribution data, it is relatively straightforward to determine whether NPF took place or not on a given day. Due to the noisiness of the real-world ambient data, currently the most reliable way to classify measurement days into NPF event/non-event days is a manual visualization method. However, manual labor, with long multi-year time series, is extremely time-consuming and human subjectivity poses challenges for comparing the results of different data sets. These complications call for an automated classification process. This article presents a Bayesian neural network (BNN) classifier to classify event/non-event days of NPF using a manually generated database at the SMEAR II station in Hyytiälä, Finland. For the classification, a set of informative features are extracted exploiting the properties of multi-modal log normal distribution fitted to the aerosol particle concentration database and the properties of the time series representation of the data at different scales. The proposed method has a classification accuracy of 84.2 % for determining event/non-event days. In particular, the BNN method successfully predicts all event days when the growth and formation rate can be determined with a good confidence level (often labeled as class Ia days). Most misclassified days (with an accuracy of 75 %) are the event days of class II, where the determination of growth and formation rate are much more uncertain. Nevertheless, the results reported in this article using the new machine learning-based approach points towards the potential of these methods and suggest further exploration in this direction."

These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classification archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difficult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classifiers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are significantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only 9 of these algorithms are significantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classifier, the Collective of Transformation Ensembles, is significantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more rigorous testing of new algorithms in the future."

Information can be extracted from the properties of time series for tasks such as classification (e.g., assigning species to individual bird calls); clustering (e.g., clustering similar responses in population dynamics to abrupt changes in the environment or management interventions); prediction (e.g., accuracy of model predictions to original time series data); and anomaly detection (e.g., detecting possible catastrophic events from population time series). These common tasks in ecological research all rely on the notion of (dis‐) similarity, which can be determined using distance measures. A plethora of distance measures have been described, predominantly in the computer and information sciences, but many have not been introduced to ecologists. Furthermore, little is known about how to select appropriate distance measures for time‐series‐related tasks. Therefore, many potential applications remain unexplored. Here, we describe 16 properties of distance measures that are likely to be of importance to a variety of ecological questions involving time series. We then test 42 distance measures for each property and use the results to develop an objective method to select appropriate distance measures for any task and ecological dataset. We demonstrate our selection method by applying it to a set of real‐world data on breeding bird populations in the UK and discuss other potential applications for distance measures, along with associated technical issues common in ecology. Our real‐world population trends exhibit a common challenge for time series comparisons: a high level of stochasticity. We demonstrate two different ways of overcoming this challenge, first by selecting distance measures with properties that make them well suited to comparing noisy time series and second by applying a smoothing algorithm before selecting appropriate distance measures. In both cases, the distance measures chosen through our selection method are not only fit‐for‐purpose but are consistent in their rankings of the population trends. The results of our study should lead to an improved understanding of, and greater scope for, the use of distance measures for comparing ecological time series and help us answer new ecological questions."

However, although the learned shapelets are discriminative, they are not always similar to pieces of a real series in the dataset. This makes it difficult to interpret the decision, i.e. difficult to analyze if there are particular behaviors in a series that triggered the decision. In this paper, we make use of a simple convolutional network to tackle the time series classification task and we introduce an adversarial regularization to constrain the model to learn more interpretable shapelets. Our classification results on all the usual time series benchmarks are comparable with the results obtained by similar state-of-the-art algorithms but our adversarially regularized method learns shapelets that are, by design, interpretable."

The objectives were to (1) develop a methodology to predict individual crop species or or management regimes; (2) investigate the earliest time point in the growing season when the species predictions are satisfactory; and (3) to present a method to assess the uncertainty of the predictions at an individual field level. Seventeen Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes (VV and VH polarizations) acquired in interferometric wide swath mode from 14 May through to 30 August 2017 in the same geometry, and selected based on the weather conditions, were used in the study. The improved k nearest neighbour estimation, ik-NN, with a genetic algorithm feature optimization was tailored for classification with optional Sentinel-1 data sets, species groupings, and thresholds for the minimum parcel area. The number of species groups varied from 7 to as large as 41. Multinomial logistic regression was tested as an optional method. The Overall Accuracies (OA) varied depending on the number of species included in the classification, and whether all or not field parcels were included. OA with nine species groups was 72% when all parcels were included, 81% when the parcels area threshold (for incorporating parcels into classification) was 0.5 ha, and around 90% when the threshold was 4 ha. The OA gradually increased when adding extra Sentinel-1 scenes up until the early August, and the initial scenes were acquired in early June or mid-May. After that, only minor improvements in the crop recognition accuracy were noted. The ik-NN method gave greater overall accuracies than the logistic regression analysis with all data combinations tested. The width of the 95% confidence intervals with ik-NN for the estimate of the probability of the species with the largest probability on an individual parcel varied depending on the species, the area threshold of the parcel and the number of the Sentinel-1 scenes used. The results ranged between 0.06–0.08 units (6–8% points) for the most common species when the Sentinel-1 scenes were between 1 June and 12 August. The results were well-received by the authorities and encourage further research to continue the study towards an operational method in which the space-borne SAR data are a part of the information chain."

Recently, modeling of time-series has become a topic of interest in data mining. Conducting an analysis of multivariate time series effectively is an essential task for decision-making activities in fields such as meteorology, medicine, and finance. Features selection is a key problem in the analysis of multivariate time series. Rainfall prediction, biomedical classification, pattern recognition, sensor network analysis and so on all have different input features. The problem is that these features have interdependencies and time-delay relationships. Currently, research on the selection of input features of these data still depends on whether they are linear or non-linear. In this paper, we propose a new integration strategy between Pearson Correlation and Symmetrical Uncertainty for relevant feature selection based on linear and non-linear relationships for multivariate time-series classification. We evaluated the goodness of fit of feature subsets using merit value. The meteorological data set was used to test the proposed method. The result showed that the method was able to reduce the number of features by 77.9% features and increase their merit value 2.25 times compared to no input features selection."

This kind of data can be found in many real world settings. Classifying time series is a difficult task and an active area of research. This paper investigates the use of transfer learning in Deep Neural Networks and a 2D representation of time series known as Recurrence Plots. In order to utilize the research done in the area of image classification, where Deep Neural Networks have achieved very good results, we use a Residual Neural Networks architecture known as ResNet. As preprocessing of time series is a major part of every time series classification pipeline, the method proposed simplifies this step and requires only few parameters. For the first time we propose a method for multi time series classification: Training a single network to classify all datasets in the archive with one network. We are among the first to evaluate the method on the latest 2018 release of the UCR archive, a well established time series classification benchmarking dataset."

The success of each technique is earmarked by measures of efficiency and accuracy. In order to achieve efficiency and accuracy, existing methods detect the relevant data in segments within a time series. Within this trend, we propose a framework for Detecting Optimal Partial Observation (DOPO) in time series classification. The framework developed is applicable to any time series database. It isolates the most relevant data for classification and eliminates excess data. This framework measures accuracy of partial observations by utilizing a $10 \times 5$ fold cross validation. In this paper, the DOPO framework is tested on all 85 data sets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. The time series classification method Dynamic Time Warping with 1-nearest neighbor is used with the framework. Our results indicate that the framework improved or maintained accuracy in a majority of tested data sets, while sensing only half the data."

However, speed for real-time classification, interpretability of the results and necessary computational resources, make them difficult to use in real life problems compared to traditional feature based or similarity based time series classification methods. Judicious use of local features of time series is supposed to be the key point to improve the performance and interpretability. In this work, three new linear time complexity shape aware feature extraction methods leading to the computation of similarities of two time series, are proposed. Their performances are compared to the most popular Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with the k- Nearest Neighbor classifier (kNN) as the baseline classifier (kNN-DTW) by simulation experiments with 43 benchmark time series data sets. It is found that the proposed approach can achieve higher classification accuracies for some datasets while computationally lighter for all the data sets than DTW."

The research focus has mostly been on improving the accuracy and efficiency of classifiers, while their interpretability has been somewhat neglected. Classifier interpretability has become a critical constraint for many application domains and the introduction of the 'right to explanation' GDPR EU legislation in May 2018 is likely to further emphasize the importance of explainable learning algorithms. In this work we analyse the state-of-the-art for time series classification, and propose new algorithms that aim to maintain the classifier accuracy and efficiency, but keep interpretability as a key design constraint. We present new time series classification algorithms that advance the state-of-the-art by implementing the following three key ideas: (1) Multiple resolutions of symbolic approximations: we combine symbolic representations obtained using different parameters; (2) Multiple domain representations: we combine symbolic approximations in time (e.g., SAX) and frequency (e.g., SFA) domains; (3) Efficient navigation of a huge symbolic-words space: we adapt a symbolic sequence classifier named SEQL, to make it work with multiple domain representations (e.g., SAX-SEQL, SFA-SEQL), and use its greedy feature selection strategy to effectively filter the best features for each representation. We show that a multi-resolution multi-domain linear classifier, SAX-SFA-SEQL, achieves a similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art COTE ensemble, and to a recent deep learning method (FCN), but uses a fraction of the time required by either COTE or FCN. We discuss the accuracy, efficiency and interpretability of our proposed algorithms. To further analyse the interpretability aspect of our classifiers, we present a case study on an ecology benchmark."

There are two main paradigms in combining classifiers: classifier selection, where each classifier is considered as an expert in some local area of the feature space, and classifier fusion, where all classifiers are trained over the entire feature space and they are considered as competitive and complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble technique, NeuroEnsemble, that follows the classifier fusion paradigm applied on time series data. The Neuro-Ensemble exploits the idea that different classifiers participating in the ensemble have varying degrees of expertise on learning different class labels and it optimizes the ensemble using a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based meta-learner to capture the expertise of individual classifiers. Every neuron in the MLP represents a classifier that contributes with a vote and performs activation and state computations. This work is the first attempt to train a neural network for learning the expertise of each classifier in an ensemble and optimize the entire classification schema based on class-level expertise weights. We validated our Neuro-Ensemble on 43 real-world time series datasets from the UCR repository. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in comparison with individual baseline learners and ensemble techniques."

Recently, there are some attempts to leverage such order information to first pre-train time-series models by reconstructing time-series values of randomly masked time segments, followed by an end-task fine-tuning on the same dataset, demonstrating improved end-task performance. However, this learning paradigm decouples data reconstruction from the end task. We argue that the representations learnt in this way are not informed by the end task and may, therefore, be sub-optimal for the end-task performance. In fact, the importance of different timestamps can vary significantly in different end tasks. We believe that representations learnt by reconstructing important timestamps would be a better strategy for improving end-task performance. In this work, we propose TARNet, Task-Aware Reconstruction Network, a new model using Transformers to learn task-aware data reconstruction that augments end-task performance. Specifically, we design a data-driven masking strategy that uses self-attention score distribution from end-task training to sample timestamps deemed important by the end task. Then, we mask out data at those timestamps and reconstruct them, thereby making the reconstruction task-aware. This reconstruction task is trained alternately with the end task at every epoch, sharing parameters in a single model, allowing the representation learnt through reconstruction to improve end-task performance. Extensive experiments on tens of classification and regression datasets show that TARNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models across all evaluation metrics."

Hence, requiring the presence of all modalities for a given sample is not realistic for clinical tasks and significantly limits the size of the dataset during training.

We evaluate the fusion method and introduce new benchmark results for in-hospital mortality prediction and phenotype classification, using clinical time-series data in the MIMIC-IV dataset and corresponding chest X-ray images in MIMIC-CXR. Compared to more complex multi-modal fusion strategies, MedFuse provides a performance improvement by a large margin on the fully paired test set. It also remains robust across the partially paired test set containing samples with missing chest X-ray images. We release our code for reproducibility and to enable the evaluation of competing models in the future."

Worldwide, humankind keeps an enormous number of domesticated birds (e.g. chickens) for their eggs and their meat, providing rich sources of low-fat protein. However, around the world, there have been growing concerns about the quality of life for the livestock in poultry farms; and increasingly vocal demands for improved standards of animal welfare. Recent advances in sensing technologies and machine learning allow the possibility of automatically assessing the health of some individual birds, and employing the lessons learned to improve the welfare for all birds. This task superficially appears to be easy, given the dramatic progress in recent years in classifying human behaviors, and given that human behaviors are presumably more complex. However, as we shall demonstrate, classifying chicken behaviors poses several unique challenges, chief among which is creating a generalizable ""dictionary"" of behaviors from sparse and noisy data. In this work we introduce a novel time series dictionary learning algorithm that can robustly learn from weakly labeled data sources."

Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data of the Copernicus program offer time series with temporal, spatial, radiometric, and spectral characteristics that have great potential for mapping and monitoring agricultural crops. This paper presents an approach which synergistically uses these multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series for the classification of 17 crop classes at 10 m spatial resolution for Germany in the year 2018. Input data for the Random Forest (RF) classification are monthly statistics of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. This approach reduces the amount of input data and pre-processing steps while retaining phenological information, which is crucial for crop type discrimination. For training and validation, Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data were available covering 15 of the 16 German Federal States. An overall map accuracy of 75.5% was achieved, with class-specific F1-scores above 80% for winter wheat, maize, sugar beet, and rapeseed. By combining optical and SAR data, overall accuracies could be increased by 6% and 9%, respectively, compared to single sensor approaches. While no increase in overall accuracy could be achieved by stratifying the classification in natural landscape regions, the class-wise accuracies for all but the cereal classes could be improved, on average, by 7%. In comparison to census data, the crop areas could be approximated well with, on average, only 1% of deviation in class-specific acreages. Using this streamlined approach, similar accuracies for the most widespread crop types as well as for smaller permanent crop classes were reached as in other Germany-wide crop type studies, indicating its potential for repeated nationwide crop type mapping."

The literature contains several methods that aim to solve the time series classification problem, such as the artificial neural network (ANN) and the support vector machine (SVM). Time series classification is a supervised learning method that maps the input to the output using historical data. The primary objective is to discover interesting patterns hidden in the data. In this study, we use a new method called SVNN which combines the SVM and ANN classification techniques to solve the time series data classification problem. The proposed SVNN is applied to six benchmark UCR time series datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the ANN and SVM on all datasets. Further comparison with other approaches in the literature also shows that the SVNN is able to maximise accuracy. It is believed that combining classification techniques can give better results in terms of accuracy and better solutions for time series classification."

However, preparing such a dataset is very laborious since each single data instance should be fully guaranteed to be normal. It is, therefore, desired to explore multivariate time series anomaly detection methods based on the dataset without any label knowledge. In this paper, we propose MTGFlow, an unsupervised anomaly detection approach forMultivariate Time series anomaly detection via dynamic Graph and entityaware normalizing Flow, leaning only on a widely accepted hypothesis that abnormal instances exhibit sparse densities than the normal. However, the complex interdependencies among entities and the diverse inherent characteristics of each entity pose significant challenges to density estimation, let alone to detect anomalies based on the estimated possibility distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to learn the mutual and dynamic relations among entities via a graph structure learning model, which helps to model the accurate distribution of multivariate time series. Moreover, taking account of distinct characteristics of the individual entities, an entity-aware normalizing flow is developed to describe each entity into a parameterized normal distribution, thereby producing fine-grained density estimation. Incorporating these two strategies, MTGFlow achieves superior anomaly detection performance. Experiments on five public datasets with seven baselines are conducted, MTGFlow outperforms the SOTA methods by up to 5.0 AUROC%."

Recently, developments in machine learning and neural networks have given rise to non-linear time series models that provide modern and promising alternatives to traditional methods of analysis. In this paper, we present an ensemble of independent and parallel long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks for the prediction of stock price movement. LSTMs have been shown to be especially suited for time series data due to their ability to incorporate past information, while neural network ensembles have been found to reduce variability in results and improve generalization. A binary classification problem based on the median of returns is used, and the ensemble’s forecast depends on a threshold value, which is the minimum number of LSTMs required to agree upon the result. The model is applied to the constituents of the smaller, less efficient Stockholm OMX30 instead of other major market indices such as the DJIA and S&P500 commonly found in literature. With a straightforward trading strategy, comparisons with a randomly chosen portfolio and a portfolio containing all the stocks in the index show that the portfolio resulting from the LSTM ensemble provides better average daily returns and higher cumulative returns over time. Moreover, the LSTM portfolio also exhibits less volatility, leading to higher risk-return ratios."

Furthermore, croplands are known as water guzzlers by consuming anywhere between 70% and 90% of all human water use globally. Given these facts and the increase in global population to nearly 10 billion by the year 2050, the need for routine, rapid, and automated cropland mapping year-after-year and/or season-after-season is of great importance. The overarching goal of this study was to generate standard and routine cropland products, year-after-year, over very large areas through the use of two novel methods: (a) quantitative spectral matching techniques (QSMTs) applied at continental level and (b) rule-based Automated Cropland Classification Algorithm (ACCA) with the ability to hind-cast, now-cast, and future-cast. Australia was chosen for the study given its extensive croplands, rich history of agriculture, and yet nonexistent routine yearly generated cropland products using multi-temporal remote sensing. This research produced three distinct cropland products using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m normalized difference vegetation index 16-day composite time-series data for 16 years: 2000 through 2015. The products consisted of: (1) cropland extent/areas versus cropland fallow areas, (2) irrigated versus rainfed croplands, and (3) cropping intensities: single, double, and continuous cropping. An accurate reference cropland product (RCP) for the year 2014 (RCP2014) produced using QSMT was used as a knowledge base to train and develop the ACCA algorithm that was then applied to the MODIS time-series data for the years 2000–2015. A comparison between the ACCA-derived cropland products (ACPs) for the year 2014 (ACP2014) versus RCP2014 provided an overall agreement of 89.4% (kappa = 0.814) with six classes: (a) producer’s accuracies varying between 72% and 90% and (b) user’s accuracies varying between 79% and 90%. ACPs for the individual years 2000–2013 and 2015 (ACP2000–ACP2013, ACP2015) showed very strong similarities with several other studies. The extent and vigor of the Australian croplands versus cropland fallows were accurately captured by the ACCA algorithm for the years 2000–2015, thus highlighting the value of the study in food security analysis. The ACCA algorithm and the cropland products are released through http://croplands.org/app/map and http://geography.wr.usgs.gov/science/croplands/algorithms/australia_250m.html"

Studies have been conducted to mitigate classification problems associated with the use of single data (e.g., such as cloud contamination) through multi-sensor data fusion and the use of time series data. This study investigated two areas with different environment and climate conditions: one in South Korea and the other in US. Cropland classification was conducted by using multi-temporal Landsat 5, Radarsat-1 and digital elevation models (DEM) based on two machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest and support vector machines). Seven classification scenarios were examined and evaluated through accuracy assessment. Results show that SVM produced the best performance (overall accuracy of 93.87%) when using all temporal and spectral data as input variables.

In this study, we used MODIS time series data to investigate the effect of the time series length on crop mapping. Eight time series with different lengths (ranging from one month to eight months) were tested. For each time series, we first used the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to calculate the importance score for all features (including multi-spectral data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and phenological metrics). Subsequently, an extension of the Jeffries–Matusita (JM) distance was used to measure class separability for each time series. Finally, the RF algorithm was used to classify crop types, and the classification accuracy and certainty were used to analyze the influence of the time series length and the number of features on classification performance; the features were added one by one based on their importance scores. Results indicated that when the time series was longer than five months, the top ten features remained stable. These features were mainly in July and August. In addition, the NDVI features contributed the majority of the most significant features for crop mapping. The NDWI and data from multi-spectral bands also contributed to improving crop mapping. On the other hand, separability, classification accuracy, and certainty increased with the number of features used and the time series length, although these values quickly reached saturation. Five months was the optimal time series length, as longer time series provided no further improvement in the classification performance. This result shows that relatively short time series have the potential to identify crops accurately, which allows for early crop mapping over large areas."

Timely and accurate identification and mapping of garlic are significant for garlic yield prediction and garlic market management. Previous studies on garlic mapping were mainly based on all observations of the entire growing season, so the resulting maps have a hysteresis. Here, we determined the optimal identification strategy and the earliest identifiable phenophase for garlic based on all available Landsat 8/9 time series imagery in Google Earth Engine. Specifically, we evaluated the performance of different vegetation indices for each phenophase to determine the optimal classification metrics for garlic. Secondly, we identified garlic using random forest algorithm and classification metrics of different time series lengths. Finally, we determined the earliest identifiable phenophase of garlic and generated an early-season garlic distribution map. Garlic could be identified as early as March (bud differentiation period) with an F1 of 0.91. Our study demonstrates the differences in the performance of vegetation indices at different phenophases, and these differences provide a new idea for mapping crops. The generated early-season garlic distribution map provides timely data support for various stakeholders."

Traditional fusion rules use the product of multi-single classifiers, but that strategy cannot integrate the classification output of machine learning classifiers. In this research, the performance of two hybrid strategies, multiple voting (M-voting) and probabilistic fusion (P-fusion), for crop classification using NDVI time series were tested with different training sample sizes at both pixel and object levels, and two representative counties in north Xinjiang were selected as study area. The single classifiers employed in this research included Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and See 5 (C 5.0). The results indicated that classification performance improved (increased the mean overall accuracy by 5%~10%, and reduced standard deviation of overall accuracy by around 1%) substantially with the training sample number, and when the training sample size was small (50 or 100 training samples), hybrid classifiers substantially outperformed single classifiers with higher mean overall accuracy (1%~2%). However, when abundant training samples (4,000) were employed, single classifiers could achieve good classification accuracy, and all classifiers obtained similar performances. Additionally, although object-based classification did not improve accuracy, it resulted in greater visual appeal, especially in study areas with a heterogeneous cropping pattern."

 In this article, the performance evaluation of four univariate time-series forecasting techniques, namely Hyndman Khandakar-Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (HK-SARIMA), Non-Stationary Thomas-Fiering (NSTF), Yeo-Johnson Transformed Non-Stationary Thomas-Fiering (YJNSTF) and Seasonal Naïve (SN) method, is carried out. The techniques are applied to forecast the rainfall time series of the stations located in Kerala. It enables an assessment of the significant difference in the rainfall characteristics at various locations that influence the relative forecasting accuracies of the models. Along with this, the effectiveness of Yeo-Johnson transformation (YJT) in improving the forecast accuracy of the models is assessed. Rainfall time series of 18 stations in Kerala, India, starting from 1981 and ending in 2013, is used. A classification system based on root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) is proposed and applied to find the best forecasting model. The models HK-SARIMA and YJNSTF performed well in the Western lowlands and Eastern highlands. In Central midlands, out of 12 stations, the performance indices of 8 stations are in favour of the HK-SARIMA model. It can be concluded that HK-SARIMA models are more reliable for forecasting the monthly rainfall of the stations located in all geographic regions in the state of Kerala."

The key idea behind most few-shot learning approaches is to pre-train the model with a large number of instances from a different but related class of data, classes for which a large number of instances are available for training. Few-shot learning has been most successfully demonstrated for classification problems using Siamese deep learning neural networks. Few-shot learning is less extensively applied to time-series forecasting. Few-shot forecasting is the task of predicting future values of a time-series even when only a small set of historic time-series is available. Few-shot forecasting has applications in domains where a long history of data is not available. This work describes deep neural network architectures for few-shot forecasting. All the architectures use a Siamese twin network approach to learn a difference function between pairs of time-series, rather than directly forecasting based on historical data as seen in traditional forecasting models. The networks are built using Long short-term memory units (LSTM). During forecasting, a model is able to forecast time-series types that were never seen in the training data by using the few available instances of the new time-series type as reference inputs. The proposed architectures are evaluated on Vehicular traffic data collected in California from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The models were trained with traffic flow data collected at specific locations and then are evaluated by predicting traffic at different locations at different time horizons (0 to 12 hours). The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was used as the evaluation metric and also as the loss function for training. The proposed architectures show lower prediction error than a baseline nearest neighbor forecast model. The prediction error increases at longer time horizons."

However, unlike other domains, time series classification datasets are often small. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel time series data augmentation called guided warping. While many data augmentation methods are based on random transformations, guided warping exploits the element alignment properties of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and shapeDTW, a high-level DTW method based on shape descriptors, to deterministically warp sample patterns. In this way, the time series are mixed by warping the features of a sample pattern to match the time steps of a reference pattern. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative teacher in order to serve as a directed reference for the guided warping. We evaluate the method on all 85 datasets in the 2015 UCR Time Series Archive with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The code with an easy to use implementation can be found at https://github.com/uchidalab/time_series_augmentation."

backscattering time signature. Therefore, the advent of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 program expands studies of radar data (C-band) for rice monitoring at regional scales, due to the high temporal resolution and free data distribution. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model has reached state-of-the-art in the pattern recognition of time-sequenced data, obtaining a significant advantage at crop classification on the remote sensing images. One of the most used approaches in the RNN model is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and its improvements, such as Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM). Bi-LSTM models are more effective as their output depends on the previous and the next segment, in contrast to the unidirectional LSTM models. The present research aims to map rice crops from Sentinel-1 time series (band C) using LSTM and Bi-LSTM models in West Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). We compared the results with traditional Machine Learning techniques: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Normal Bayes (NB). The developed methodology can be subdivided into the following steps: (a) acquisition of the Sentinel time series over two years; (b) data pre-processing and minimizing noise from 3D spatial-temporal filters and smoothing with Savitzky-Golay filter; (c) time series classification procedures; (d) accuracy analysis and comparison among the methods. The results show high overall accuracy and Kappa (>97% for all methods and metrics). Bi-LSTM was the best model, presenting statistical differences in the McNemar test with a significance of 0.05. However, LSTM and Traditional Machine Learning models also achieved high accuracy values. The study establishes an adequate methodology for mapping the rice crops in West Rio Grande do Sul."

(SOC) stocks are a remarkable property for soil and environmental monitoring. The understanding of their dynamics in crop soils must go forward. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of temporal environmental controlling factors obtained by satellite images over the SOC stocks along soil depth, using machine learning algorithms. The work was carried out in São Paulo state (Brazil) in an area of 2577 km2. We obtained a dataset of boreholes with soil analyses from topsoil to subsoil (0–100 cm). Additionally, remote sensing covariates (30 years of land use history, vegetation indexes), soil properties (i.e., clay, sand, mineralogy), soil types (classification), geology, climate and relief information were used. All covariates were confronted with SOC stocks contents, to identify their impact. Afterwards, the abilities of the predictive models were tested by splitting soil samples into two random groups (70 for training and 30% for model testing). We observed that the mean values of SOC stocks decreased by increasing the depth in all land use and land cover (LULC) historical classes. The results indicated that the random forest with recursive features elimination (RFE) was an accurate technique for predicting SOC stocks and finding controlling factors. We also found that the soil properties (especially clay and CEC), terrain attributes, geology, bioclimatic parameters and land use history were the most critical factors in controlling the SOC stocks in all LULC history and soil depths. We concluded that random forest coupled with RFE could be a functional approach to detect, map and monitor SOC stocks using environmental and remote sensing data."

Elastic similarity and distance measures can compensate for misalignments in the time axis of time series data. We adapt two existing strategies used in a multivariate version of the well-known Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), namely, Independent and Dependent DTW, to these seven measures. While these measures can be applied to various time series analysis tasks, we demonstrate their utility on multivariate time series classification using the nearest neighbor classifier. On 23 well-known datasets, we demonstrate that each of the measures but one achieves the highest accuracy relative to others on at least one dataset, supporting the value of developing a suite of multivariate similarity and distance measures. We also demonstrate that there are datasets for which either the dependent versions of all measures are more accurate than their independent counterparts or vice versa. In addition, we also construct a nearest neighbor-based ensemble of the measures and show that it is competitive to other state-of-the-art single-strategy multivariate time series classifiers."

A one-year time-series of Sentinel-1 images acquired over an agricultural area in Spain, in which 17 crop species are present, is exploited for this purpose. Different options regarding temporal baselines, polarization, and combination with radiometric data (backscattering coefficient) are analyzed. Results show that both radiometric and interferometric features provide notable classification accuracy when used individually (overall accuracy lies between 70% and 80%). It is found that the shortest temporal baseline coherences (6 days) and the use of all available intensity images perform best, hence proving the advantage of the 6-day revisit time provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation with respect to longer revisit times. It is also shown that dual-pol data always provide better classification results than single-pol ones. More importantly, when both coherence and backscattering coefficient are jointly used, a significant increase in accuracy is obtained (greater than 7% in overall accuracies). Individual accuracies of all crop types are increased, and an overall accuracy above 86% is reached.

Reducing the error-rate of classifiers is the main motivation. In this paper, we generate synthetic training samples of time series data using a simple implementation of the Variational Autoencoder, to test whether classification performance increases when augmenting the original training sets with manifolds of generated samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation using the Variational Autoencoder as a generative model, by conducting experiments with different standard classifiers evaluated on nine datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. We show that our method is beneficial in most cases, as we observed an increase of accuracy and F1-Score on all datasets."

However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods."

These include variants of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), such as weighted and derivative DTW, and edit distance-based measures, including Longest Common Subsequence and Time Warp Edit Distance. These measures have the common characteristic that they operate in the time domain and compensate for potential localised misalignment through some elastic adjustment. Our aim is to experimentally test two hypotheses related to these distance measures. Firstly, we test whether there is any significant difference in accuracy for TSC problems between nearest neighbour classifiers using these distance measures. Secondly, we test whether combining these elastic distance measures through simple ensemble schemes gives significantly better accuracy. We test these hypotheses by carrying out one of the largest experimental studies ever conducted into time series classification. Our first key finding is that there is no significant difference between the elastic distance measures in terms of classification accuracy on our data sets. Our second finding, and the major contribution of this work, is to define an ensemble classifier that significantly outperforms the individual classifiers. Nearly all TSC papers in the data mining literature cite DTW (with warping window set through cross validation) as the benchmark for comparison. We believe that our ensemble is the first ever classifier to significantly outperform DTW and as such raises the bar for future work in this area."

Increasing research attention has been paid to detecting coughs using wearables, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Microphone is most widely used sensor to detect coughs. However, the intense power consumption needed to process audio hinders continuous audio-based cough detection on battery-limited commercial wearables, such as earbuds. We present CoughTrigger, which utilizes a lower-power sensor, inertial measurement unit (IMU), in earbuds as a cough detection activator to trigger a higher-power sensor for audio processing and classification. It runs all-the-time as a standby service with minimal battery consumption and triggers the audio-based cough detection when a candidate cough is detected from IMU. Besides, the use of IMU brings the benefit of improved specificity of cough detection. Experiments are conducted on 45 subjects and CoughTrigger achieved 0.77 AUC score. We also validated its effectiveness on free-living data and through on-device implementation."

In this paper mobility trends are estimated at several aggregation levels, using multilevel time series models. The models account for discontinuities induced by two survey redesigns and outliers due to less reliable outcomes in one particular year. The input for the model is direct annual estimates with their standard errors for the period 1999–2017 for a detailed cross‐classification in 504 domains. Appropriate transformations for the direct estimates and generalized variance functions to smooth the standard errors of the direct estimates are proposed. The models are fitted in an hierarchical Bayesian framework using MCMC simulations. From the model outputs smooth trend estimates are computed at the most detailed domain level.

The complexity and multivariate nature of drought challenges its assessment, especially at local scales. The study aimed to assess spatiotemporal patterns of crop condition and drought impact at the spatial scale of field management units with a combined use of time-series from optical (Landsat, MODIS, Sentinel-2) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel 1) data. Several indicators were derived such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Tasseled cap indices and Sentinel-1 based backscattering intensity and relative surface moisture. We used logistic regression to evaluate the drought-induced variability of remotely sensed parameters estimated for different phases of crop growth. The parameters with the highest prediction rate were further used to estimate thresholds for drought/non-drought classification. The models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and validated with in-situ data. The results revealed that not all remotely sensed variables respond in the same manner to drought conditions. Growing season maximum NDVI and NDMI (70–75%) and SAR derived metrics (60%) reflect specifically the impact of agricultural drought. These metrics also depict stress affected areas with a larger spatial extent. LST was a useful indicator of crop condition especially for maize and sunflower with prediction rates of 86% and 71%, respectively. The developed approach can be further used to assess crop condition and to support decision-making in areas which are more susceptible and vulnerable to drought."

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems are increasingly available in crop mapping, as they provide all-weather imagery. In particular, the Sentinel-1 sensor provides dense time-series data, thus offering a unique opportunity for crop mapping. However, in most studies, the Sentinel-1 complex backscatter coefficient was used directly which limits the potential of the Sentinel-1 in crop mapping. Meanwhile, most of the existing methods may not be tailored for the task of crop classification in time-series polarimetric SAR data. To solve the above problem, we present a novel deep learning strategy in this research. To be specific, we collected Sentinel-1 time-series data in two study areas. The Sentinel-1 image covariance matrix is used as an input to maintain the integrity of polarimetric information. Then, a depthwise separable convolution recurrent neural network (DSCRNN) architecture is proposed to characterize crop types from multiple perspectives and achieve better classification results. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves better accuracy in complex agricultural areas than other classical methods. Additionally, the variable importance provided by the random forest (RF) illustrated that the covariance vector has a far greater influence than the backscatter coefficient. Consequently, the strategy proposed in this research is effective and promising for crop mapping."

In this study, we assimilated monthly crop phenology from January to December 2018 by using the NDVI time series derived from moderate to high Spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel and Landsat data in cropland field at Samara airport area, Russia. The results support the potential of Sentinel and Landsat data derived NDVI time series for accurate crop phenological monitoring with all crop growth stages such as active tillering, jointing, maturity and harvesting according to crop calendar with reasonable thematic accuracy. This satellite data generated NDVI based work has great potential to provide valuable support for assessing crop growth status and the above-mentioned objectives with sustainable agriculture development."

Successful adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) created an explosion in digital clinical data available for analysis, but progress in machine learning for healthcare research has been difficult to measure because of the absence of publicly available benchmark data sets. To address this problem, we propose four clinical prediction benchmarks using data derived from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. These tasks cover a range of clinical problems including modeling risk of mortality, forecasting length of stay, detecting physiologic decline, and phenotype classification. We propose strong linear and neural baselines for all four tasks and evaluate the effect of deep supervision, multitask training and data-specific architectural modifications on the performance of neural models."

Such samples of adversaries could become a security concern. In this paper, we propose transforming the existing adversarial transformation network (ATN) on a distilled model to attack various multivariate time series classification models. The proposed attack on the classification model utilizes a distilled model as a surrogate that mimics the behavior of the attacked classical multivariate time series classification models. The proposed methodology is tested onto 1-Nearest Neighbor Dynamic Time Warping (1-NN DTW) and a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), all of which are trained on 18 University of East Anglia (UEA) and University of California Riverside (UCR) datasets. We show both models were susceptible to attacks on all 18 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, adversarial attacks have only been conducted in the domain of univariate time series and have not been conducted on multivariate time series. such an attack on time series classification models has never been done before. Additionally, we recommend future researchers that develop time series classification models to incorporating adversarial data samples into their training data sets to improve resilience on adversarial samples and to consider model robustness as an evaluative metric."

However, existing techniques suffer from two major issues. First, the long-range dependencies of the time-series sequences are not well captured. Second, the interactions of multiple variables are generally not represented in features. To address these aforementioned issues, we propose a novel Cross Attention Stabilized Fully Convolutional Neural Network (CA-SFCN) to classify MTS data. First, we introduce a temporal attention mechanism to extract long- and short-term memories across all time steps. Second, variable attention is designed to select relevant variables at each time step. CA-SFCN is compared with 16 approaches using 14 different MTS datasets. The extensive experimental results show that the CA-SFCN outperforms state-of-the-art classification methods, and the cross attention mechanism achieves better performance than other attention mechanisms."

While many flare prediction studies do not address this problem directly, all-clear predictions can be useful in operational context. However, in all-clear predictions, finding the right balance between avoiding false negatives (misses) and reducing the false positives (false alarms) is often challenging. Our study focuses on training and testing a set of interval-based time series named Time Series Forest (TSF). These classifiers will be used towards building an all-clear flare prediction system by utilizing multivariate time series data. Throughout this paper, we demonstrate our data collection, predictive model building and evaluation processes, and compare our time series classification models with baselines using our benchmark datasets. Our results show that time series classifiers provide better forecasting results in terms of skill scores, precision and recall metrics, and they can be further improved for more precise all-clear forecasts by tuning model hyperparameters."

The deforestation process is seen as a breakpoint in the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series, associated with the change from a typical forest phenology pattern to something else (e.g., bare soil, pasture, and cropland). Therefore, to monitor this process, a near real-time time-series breakpoint-detection model is needed. In this article, we exploited the 18-year-long MODIS EVI time-series data to train a temporal pattern classification model based on convolutional neural networks. Model architecture parameters (optimizer, number of hidden layers, number of neurons, and so on) were selected using an optimization procedure. The trained model then tries to estimate the probability that a given “time-series segment” corresponds to a deforestation event. The model was validated using <italic>in situ</italic> data derived from high-resolution images. Results are promising, since the model presents good performance for the validation data set [F1-score = 0.85, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${fpr} = 0.0012$ </tex-math></inline-formula> (of the order of the true deforestation rate), <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${tpr} = 0.8$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, for a sample size = <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$50 \times 10^{3}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>] and average performance in a yearly analysis (F1-score = 0.6, sample size = <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$1120 \times 10^{3}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). Model performance was studied using two diagnostic tools: activation maps and model ensemble error estimations. Results show that proposed model presents good extrapolation capabilities, but its maximum F1-score is bounded by error in the available data set (in particular, mislabeled deforestation events)."

This paper proposed an automatic land-cover classification method using time-series Landsat data on the GEE cloud-based platform. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land-cover products (MCD12Q1.006) with the International Geosphere–Biosphere Program (IGBP) classification scheme were used to provide accurate training samples using the rules of pixel filtering and spectral filtering, which resulted in an overall accuracy (OA) of 99.2%. Two types of spectral–temporal features (percentile composited features and median composited monthly features) generated from all available Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data from the year 2010 ± 1 were used as input features to a Random Forest (RF) classifier for land-cover classification. The results showed that the monthly features outperformed the percentile features, giving an average OA of 80% against 77%. In addition, the monthly features composited using the median outperformed those composited using the maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with an average OA of 80% against 78%. Therefore, the proposed method is able to generate accurate land-cover mapping automatically based on the GEE cloud-based platform, which is promising for regional and global land-cover mapping."

Some applications, such as tracking, can use sensed acceleration and rate of rotation to calculate displacement based on physical system models. Other applications, such as activity recognition, extract manually designed features from sensor inputs for classification. Such applications face two challenges. On one hand, on-device sensor measurements are noisy. For many mobile applications, it is hard to find a distribution that exactly describes the noise in practice. Unfortunately, calculating target quantities based on physical system and noise models is only as accurate as the noise assumptions. Similarly, in classification applications, although manually designed features have proven to be effective, it is not always straightforward to find the most robust features to accommodate diverse sensor noise patterns and heterogeneous user behaviors. To this end, we propose DeepSense, a deep learning framework that directly addresses the aforementioned noise and feature customization challenges in a unified manner. DeepSense integrates convolutional and recurrent neural networks to exploit local interactions among similar mobile sensors, merge local interactions of different sensory modalities into global interactions, and extract temporal relationships to model signal dynamics. DeepSense thus provides a general signal estimation and classification framework that accommodates a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepSense using three representative and challenging tasks: car tracking with motion sensors, heterogeneous human activity recognition, and user identification with biometric motion analysis. DeepSense significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all three tasks. In addition, we show that DeepSense is feasible to implement on smartphones and embedded devices thanks to its moderate energy consumption and low latency."

Optical image time series have proven to be efficient for sugarcane mapping. There are, however, two limitations associated with previous research: one is that the critical observations during the sugarcane growing season are limited due to frequent cloudy weather in South China; the other is that the classification method requires imagery time series covering the entire growing season, which reduces the time efficiency. The Sentinel-1A (S1A) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data featuring relatively high spatial-temporal resolution provides an ideal data source for all-weather observations. In this study, we attempted to develop a method for the early season mapping of sugarcane. First, we proposed a framework consisting of two procedures: initial sugarcane mapping using the S1A SAR imagery time series, followed by non-vegetation removal using Sentinel-2 optical imagery. Second, we tested the framework using an incremental classification strategy based on S1A imagery covering the entire 2017–2018 sugarcane season. The study area was in Suixi and Leizhou counties of Zhanjiang city, China. Results indicated that an acceptable accuracy, in terms of Kappa coefficient, can be achieved to a level above 0.902 using time series three months before sugarcane harvest. In general, sugarcane mapping utilizing the combination of VH + VV as well as VH polarization alone outperformed mapping using VV alone. Although the XGBoost classifier with VH + VV polarization achieved a maximum accuracy that was slightly lower than the random forest (RF) classifier, the XGBoost shows promising performance in that it was more robust to overfitting with noisy VV time series and the computation speed was 7.7 times faster than RF classifier. The total sugarcane areas in Suixi and Leizhou for the 2017–2018 harvest year estimated by this study were approximately 598.95 km2 and 497.65 km2, respectively. The relative accuracy of the total sugarcane mapping area was approximately 86.3%."

Precise information about the flood extent is an essential foundation for local relief workers, decision-makers from crisis management authorities or insurance companies. In order to capture the full extent of the flood, open water and especially temporary flooded vegetation (TFV) areas have to be considered. The Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellite constellation enables the continuous monitoring of the earths surface with a short revisit time. In particular, the ability of S-1 data to penetrate the vegetation provides information about water areas underneath the vegetation. Different TFV types, such as high grassland/reed and forested areas, from independent study areas were analyzed to show both the potential and limitations of a developed SAR time series classification approach using S-1 data. In particular, the time series feature that would be most suitable for the extraction of the TFV for all study areas was investigated in order to demonstrate the potential of the time series approaches for transferability and thus for operational use. It is shown that the result is strongly influenced by the TFV type and by other environmental conditions. A quantitative evaluation of the generated inundation maps for the individual study areas is carried out by optical imagery. It shows that analyzed study areas have obtained Producer’s/User’s accuracy values for TFV between 28% and 90%/77% and 97% for pixel-based classification and between 6% and 91%/74% and 92% for object-based classification depending on the time series feature used. The analysis of the transferability for the time series approach showed that the time series feature based on VV (vertical/vertical) polarization is particularly suitable for deriving TFV types for different study areas and based on pixel elements is recommended for operational use."

Various types of deep neural network models have been introduced to time series analysis, but the important frequency information is yet lack of effective modeling. In light of this, in this paper we propose a wavelet-based neural network structure called multilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for building frequency-aware deep learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves the advantage of multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while enables the fine-tuning of all parameters under a deep neural network framework. Based on mWDN, we further propose two deep learning models called Residual Classification Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) for time series classification and forecasting, respectively. The two models take all or partial mWDN decomposed sub-series in different frequencies as input, and resort to the back propagation algorithm to learn all the parameters globally, which enables seamless embedding of wavelet-based frequency analysis into deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR datasets and a real-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our time series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance analysis method to mWDN based models, which successfully identifies those time-series elements and mWDN layers that are crucially important to time series analysis. This indeed indicates the interpretability advantage of mWDN, and can be viewed as an indepth exploration to interpretable deep learning."

Although remote sensing has an advantage for monitoring vegetation, bamboo mapping is challenging due to the spectral similarity between bamboo and forest types. To overcome difficulties in bamboo mapping, we experimented with a phenology-based approach using dense Landsat time series data in Hainan Island, China. We constructed temporal profiles of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) for estimating the phenological variation among bamboo and adjacent forest types. We then compared the classification results under an all-season feature set and single-season feature sets. Our results indicated that the phenological variations of bamboo differed greatly from adjacent forest types, implying a good potential for bamboo identification. Compared to the conventional spectra-based approach, these results also emphasized the importance of phenological features. Validation using the k-fold (k = 10) approach showed this experiment achieved reasonable levels of accuracy for bamboo mapping (PA = 88.8%; UA = 74.6%). A bamboo distribution map in Hainan Island is useful to resource inventory in the second largest island in China. The success of the method in this tropical region suggests that it might be applicable to other parts of the tropical world."

Latitude, Altitude, pressure and wind systems, distance from sea, ocean currents and relief features are the factors affecting the climate of any place. Atmosphere and earth’s surface is getting warmer. Changing rainfall patterns, unusual and unprecedented spells of hot weather are the most important impacts of climate change. Indian climate is mainly described as tropical monsoon with 4 seasons. They are winter, hot weather summer, Rainy south western monsoon, post - monsoon or north east monsoon. Data mining, data analysis can be used on meteorological data to find hidden patterns inside the data. Here the monthly rainfall data of 14 districts of Kerala form year 2008 to 2019 is taken into consideration. The data is classified as seasons consisting of 4 quarters. The purpose of this classification and analysis, is to find the climatic variations of districts that affect the Hevea (Rubber) cultivation. Hevea brasiliensis, the rubber tree is considered as the main source of Natural Rubber (NR) which is the most versatile raw material of nature, having multifarious uses .Meteorological factors and soil fertility are the critical factors that influence the growth of Hevea. Among the meteorological factors, rainfall plays an important role in the growth, and also influences the production. So this paper analyze and study the rainfall data patters of all the districts of Kerala. Here a time series analysis is used to extract the trends in seasonal rainfall and its effect is analyzed. A time series forecasting is used to predict the future rainfall from 2020 to 2030 of all districts of Kerala."

Here global DDE models were used to analyze short segments of simulated time series from a known dynamical system, the Rössler system, in high noise regimes. In a companion paper, we apply the DDE model developed here to classify short segments of encephalographic (EEG) data recorded from patients with Parkinson’s disease and healthy subjects. Nine simulated subjects in each of two distinct classes were generated by varying the bifurcation parameter b and keeping the other two parameters (a and c) of the Rössler system fixed. All choices of b were in the chaotic parameter range. We diluted the simulated data using white noise ranging from 10 to −30 dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Structure selection was supervised by selecting the number of terms, delays, and order of non-linearity of the model DDE model that best linearly separated the two classes of data. The distances d from the linear dividing hyperplane was then used to assess the classification performance by computing the area A′ under the ROC curve. The selected model was tested on untrained data using repeated random sub-sampling validation. DDEs were able to accurately distinguish the two dynamical conditions, and moreover, to quantify the changes in the dynamics. There was a significant correlation between the dynamical bifurcation parameter b of the simulated data and the classification parameter d from our analysis. This correlation still held for new simulated subjects with new dynamical parameters selected from each of the two dynamical regimes. Furthermore, the correlation was robust to added noise, being significant even when the noise was greater than the signal. We conclude that DDE models may be used as a generalizable and reliable classification tool for even small segments of noisy data."

The criteria are based on quantitative thresholds relating to the size, trends, and structure of species’ distributions and populations. However, data on these parameters are sparse and uncertain for many species and unavailable for others, potentially leading to their misclassification or classification as data deficient. We devised an approach that combines data on land‐cover change, species‐specific habitat preferences, population abundance, and dispersal distance to estimate key parameters (extent of occurrence, maximum area of occupancy, population size and trend, and degree of fragmentation) and hence predict IUCN Red List categories for species. We applied our approach to nonpelagic birds and terrestrial mammals globally (∼15,000 species). The predicted categories were fairly consistent with published IUCN Red List assessments, but more optimistic overall. We predicted 4.2% of species (467 birds and 143 mammals) to be more threatened than currently assessed and 20.2% of data deficient species (10 birds and 114 mammals) to be at risk of extinction. Incorporating the habitat fragmentation subcriterion reduced these predictions 1.5–2.3% and 6.4–14.9% (depending on the quantitative definition of fragmentation) for threatened and data deficient species, respectively, highlighting the need for improved guidance for IUCN Red List assessors on the application of this aspect of the IUCN Red List criteria. Our approach complements traditional methods of estimating parameters for IUCN Red List assessments. Furthermore, it readily provides an early‐warning system to identify species potentially warranting changes in their extinction‐risk category based on periodic updates of land‐cover information. Given our method relies on optimistic assumptions about species distribution and abundance, all species predicted to be more at risk than currently evaluated should be prioritized for reassessment."

A new approach for classification of time series uses classification trees based on shapelets. A shapelet is a subsequence extracted from one of the time series in the dataset. A disadvantage of this approach is the time required for building the shapelet-based classification tree. The search for the best shapelet requires examining all subsequences of all lengths from all time series in the training set. 
A key goal of this work was to find an evaluation order of the shapelets space which enables fast convergence to an accurate model. The comparative analysis we conducted clearly indicates that a random evaluation order yields the best results. Our empirical analysis of the distribution of high-quality shapelets within the shapelets space provides insights into why randomized shapelets sampling is superior to alternative evaluation orders. 
We present an algorithm for randomized model generation for shapelet-based classification that converges extremely quickly to a model with surprisingly high accuracy after evaluating only an exceedingly small fraction of the shapelets space."

With the increasing prevalence of DM and the rising global mean temperature, the number of heat-related AMI cases among DM patients may increase. This study compares excess risk of AMI during periods of extreme temperatures between patients with DM and without DM. Methods Distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) were used to estimate the short-term association between daily mean temperature and AMI admissions (International Classification of Diseases 9th revision [ICD-9] code: 410.00–410.99), stratified by DM status (ICD-9: 250.00–250.99), to all public hospitals in Hong Kong from 2002 to 2011, adjusting for other meteorological variables and air pollutants. Analyses were also stratified by season, age group, gender, and admission type (first admissions and readmissions). The admissions data and meteorological data were obtained from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA) and the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). Findings A total of 53,769 AMI admissions were included in the study. AMI admissions among DM patients were linearly and negatively associated with temperature in the cold season (cumulative relative risk [cumRR] [95% confidence interval] in lag 0–22 days (12 °C versus 24 °C) = 2.10 [1.62–2.72]), while those among patients without DM only started increasing when temperatures dropped below 22 °C with a weaker association (cumRR = 1.43 [1.21–1.69]). In the hot season, AMI hospitalizations among DM patients started increasing when the temperature dropped below or rose above 28.8 °C (cumRR in lag 0–4 days [30.4 versus 28.8 °C] = 1.14 [1.00–1.31]), while those among patients without DM showed no association with temperature. The differences in sensitivity to temperature between patients with DM and without DM were most apparent in the group <75 years old and among first-admission cases in the cold season. The main limitation of this study was the unavailability of data on individual exposure to ambient temperature. Conclusions DM patients had a higher increased risk of AMI admissions than non-DM patients during extreme temperatures. AMI admissions risks among DM patients rise sharply in both high and low temperatures, with a stronger effect in low temperatures, while AMI risk among non-DM patients only increased mildly in low temperatures. Targeted health protection guidelines should be provided to warn DM patients and physicians about the dangers of extreme temperatures. Further studies to project the impacts of AMI risks on DM patients by climate change are warranted."

The proposed method includes two major stages, i.e., one-class classification and subsequent spatio-temporal refinement. A one-class classification method, one-class support vector machine, was first adopted to classify Landsat image of each year, producing initial urban land classification results. These initial classification results constitute a time sequence of urban land. A spatio-temporal refinement method was then applied to improve the initial urban classification results (and urban land sequence) and to obtain a more accurate urban expansion result. The proposed method was evaluated using Landsat images over Tianjin area, China, from 1990 to 2014. Results showed that the proposed spatio-temporal refinement method significantly improved initial classification results for all 25 years, with increases in overall accuracy from 4.3% to 11.7%. Compared to an existing method, the proposed method achieved both higher classification accuracies for individual years and higher accuracy of urban expansion. The spatio-temporal analysis of the results revealed that Tianjin area experienced an accelerating double-centric urban expansion process during 1990–2014. The main urban expansion type was edge-expansion and urban expansion was spatially concentrated along railways and the coastline."

However, all these methods are distance-based which get the similarity by accumulating the distances between optimal match pairs and ignore the intrinsic differences of time series. In order to solve the drawback, we discard this distance-based technique and design a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network(SCNN) to obtain the similarity of time series in this paper. Concretely, we first extract the essential features for similarity calculation by Convolutional Neural Network and then ontain the absolute difference between the essential features of time series. To conveniently train the proposed model, we make full use of the label information of datasets and construct a new binary dataset which each example contains two original time series and a binary label. In the proposed Siamese network, the parameters are shared between two branches and we take binary cross-entropy function to train our model. Experimental results on synthetic and real time series datasets show that our SCNN model is effective and achieves improved accuracy for time series classification task compared to other time series similarity calculation methods."

The problem of unsupervised feature learning from a time-series dataset poses two challenges. First, it is known that centroids obtained by clustering time-series with high overlap do not reflect their patterns, i.e., subsequence time-series clustering is meaningless. In this paper, we show that principal component analysis, sparse coding, and non-negative matrix factorization are also meaningless for the same task, and that the systematic approach to learning meaningful features from time-series is by using the shift-invariant versions of these algorithms. Second, by comparing their shift-invariant versions on different kinds of time-series for reconstruction, prediction and classification, we show that no one algorithm is best suited for all time-series. This comparison leads to a method for automatically selecting the suitable feature learning algorithm for a given time-series dataset based on its structural properties. Generality of the method and significance of the structural properties are examined using statistical tests. The method can be implemented as a simple logic circuit, convenient for embedding in IoT hardware."

Continuous monitoring results in long seismic records that may contain various sources, which need to be classified. Manual detection and labeling of recorded seismic events are not only time-consuming, but can also be inconsistent when done manually, even in the case where it is done by the same expert. Therefore, an automated approach for the classification of continuous microseismic recordings based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed, with a multiclassifier architecture that classifies earthquakes, rockfalls, and low signal-to-noise ratio quakes. Furthermore, we propose three CNN architectures that take as input time-series data, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) maps. The suitability of these three networks is rigorously assessed over five months of continuous seismometer recordings from the active Super-Sauze landslide in France. We observe that all three architectures have excellent and very similar performance. Furthermore, we evaluate transferability to a geographically distinct seismically active site in Larissa, Greece. We demonstrate that the proposed network can detect all 86 cataloged earthquake events, having only been trained on the Super-Sauze dataset and shows good agreement with manually detected events. This is promising as it could replace the painstaking manual labeling of events in large recordings."

The nearest neighbour algorithm (NN) using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure is a leading algorithm for this task. NN compares each time series to be classiﬁed to every time series in the training database. With a training database of N time series of lengths L , each classiﬁcation requires ϑ ( N · L 2 ) computations. The databases used in almost all prior research have been relatively small (with less than 10 , 000 samples) and much of the research has focused on making DTW’s complexity linear with L , leading to a runtime complexity of O ( N · L ). As we demonstrate with an example in remote sensing, real-world time series databases are now reaching the million-to-billion scale. This wealth of training data brings the promise of higher accuracy, but raises a signiﬁcant challenge because N is becoming the limiting factor. As DTW is not a metric, indexing objects induced by its space is extremely challenging. We tackle this task in this paper. We develop TSI, a novel algorithm for Time Series Indexing which combines a hierarchy of K-means clustering with DTW-based lower-bounding. We show that, on large databases, TSI makes it possible to classify time series orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art."

Rajasekaran,2018.0,8,[],"Time series classification (TSC) is the problem of predicting class labels of time series generated by different signal sources. TSC has been a challenging problem in machine learning and statistics for many decades. TSC has many important applications in bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, and clinical predictions. A large number of classification algorithms have been developed to address TSC problem. However, there is still a lot of room for improving the accuracy of classification. Traditional approaches extract discriminative features from the time series data by applying different types of transformations. These features are then fed into standard classifiers for classification. After a tremendous success of deep neural networks in certain areas such as NLP, image processing, and speech recognition, some researchers have applied deep convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural network based approaches for TSC. Deep neural network based algorithms have established a new baseline for TSC. In this paper, we propose Ensemble Deep TimeNet (EDTNet), an ensemble of multiple deep neural networks for TSC. We have compared the accuracy of EDTNet with those of the state-of-the-art algorithms on 44 different datasets from UCR time series database. Through extensive experiments we show that EDTNet outperforms all the competing algorithms in most of the UCR datasets in terms of classification accuracy. Specifically, EDTNet outperforms the other algorithms on 26 out of the 44 datasets, whereas, the next best algorithm (FCN) has a better accuracy than the others in only 10 out of the 44.

The classification was carried out using object-based image analysis (OBIA) to create land cover maps. The classified images were used to predict the land cover changes and urban growth for 2024 and 2034. The simulation model integrated the Markov chain (MC) and Cellular Automata (CA) modelling methods and the simulated maps were compared and validated to the reference maps. The simulation results indicated high accuracy of the MC–CA integrated models. The total agreement between the simulated and the reference maps was >92% for all the simulation years. The results indicated that all five cities showed a massive urban growth between 1985 and 2014 and the predicted results showed that urban expansion is likely to continue going for 2024 and 2034 periods. The transition probabilities of land cover, such as vegetation and water, are most likely to be urban areas, first through conversion to bare soil and then to urban land use. Integrating of time-series satellite images and the MC–CA models provides a better understanding of the past, current and future patterns of land cover changes and urban growth in this region. Simulation of urban growth will help planners to develop sustainable expansion policies that may reduce the future environmental impacts."

However, there is no agreement about which are the most efficient techniques to group unlabeled time-ordered data. This is because a successful classification of time series patterns depends on the goal and the domain of interest, i.e. it is application-dependent. In this article, we study free-to-play game data. In this domain, clustering similar time series information is increasingly important due to the large amount of data collected by current mobile and web applications. We evaluate which methods cluster accurately time series of mobile games, focusing on player behavior data. We identify and validate several aspects of the clustering: the similarity measures and the representation techniques to reduce the high dimensionality of time series. As a robustness test, we compare various temporal datasets of player activity from two free-to-play video-games. With these techniques we extract temporal patterns of player behavior relevant for the evaluation of game events and game-business diagnosis. Our experiments provide intuitive visualizations to validate the results of the clustering and to determine the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, we assess the common characteristics of the players belonging to the same group. This study allows us to improve the understanding of player dynamics and churn behavior."

It is now broadly accepted that considering a temporal perspective represents a great advantage to better understand disease progression and treatment results at a molecular level. In this context, biclustering algorithms emerged as an important tool to discover local expression patterns in biomedical applications, and CCC-Biclustering arose as an efficient algorithm relying on the temporal nature of data to identify all maximal temporal patterns in gene expression time series. In this work, CCC-Biclustering was integrated in new biclustering-based classifiers for prognostic prediction. As case study we analyzed multiple gene expression time series in order to classify the response of Multiple Sclerosis patients to the standard treatment with Interferon-β, to which nearly half of the patients reveal a negative response. In this scenario, using an effective predictive model of a patient’s response would avoid useless and possibly harmful therapies for the non-responder group. The results revealed interesting potentialities to be further explored in classification problems involving other (clinical) time series."

In this article, we introduce how machine learning can be applied into time series problem. Especially, we use the airline ticket prediction problem as our specific problem. Airline companies use many different variables to determine the flight ticket prices: indicator whether the travel is during the holidays, the number of free seats in the plane etc. Some of the variables are observed, but some of them are hidden. Based on the data over a 103 day period, we trained our models, getting the best model - which is AdaBoost-Decision Tree Classification. This algorithm has best performance over the observed 8 routes which has 61.35$\%$ better performance than the random purchase strategy, and relatively small variance over these routes. And we also considered the situation that we cannot get too much historical datas for some routes (for example the route is new and does not have historical data) or we do not want to train historical data to predict to buy or wait quickly, in which problem, we used HMM Sequence Classification based AdaBoost-Decision Tree Classification to perform our prediction on 12 new routes. Finally, we got 31.71$\%$ better performance than the random purchase strategy."

A particular stock could be thriving in one period and declining in the next. Stock traders make money from buying equity when they are at their lowest and selling when they are at their highest. The logical question would be: ""What Causes Stock Prices To Change?"". At the most fundamental level, the answer to this would be the demand and supply. In reality, there are many theories as to why stock prices fluctuate, but there is no generic theory that explains all, simply because not all stocks are identical, and one theory that may apply for today, may not necessarily apply for tomorrow. This paper covers various approaches taken to attempt to predict the stock market without extensive prior knowledge or experience in the subject area, highlighting the advantages and limitations of the different techniques such as regression and classification. We formulate both short term and long term predictions. Through experimentation we achieve 81% accuracy for future trend direction using classification, 0.0117 RMSE for next day price and 0.0613 RMSE for next day change in price using regression techniques. The results obtained in this paper are achieved using only historic prices and technical indicators. Various methods, tools and evaluation techniques will be assessed throughout the course of this paper, the result of this contributes as to which techniques will be selected and enhanced in the final artefact of a stock prediction model. Further work will be conducted utilising deep learning techniques to approach the problem. This paper will serve as a preliminary guide to researchers wishing to expose themselves to this area."

Time series motifs, which are similar subsequences or frequently occurring patterns, have significant meanings for researchers especially in medical domain. With the fast growth of time series data, traditional methods for motif discovery are inefficient and not applicable to large-scale data. This work proposes an efficient Motif Discovery method for Large-scale time series (MDLats). By computing standard motifs, MDLats eliminates a majority of redundant computation in the related arts and reuses existing information to the maximum. All the motif types and subsequences are generated for subsequent analysis and classification. Our system is implemented on a Hadoop platform and deployed in a hospital for clinical electrocardiography classification. The experiments on real-world healthcare data show that MDLats outperform the state-of-the-art methods even in large time series."

In this paper, a network intrusion detection classification model (NIDS-CNNLSTM) based on deep learning is constructed for the wireless sensing scenario of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to effectively distinguish and identify network traffic data and ensure the security of the equipment and operation of the IIoT. NIDS-CNNLSTM combines the powerful learning ability of long short-term memory neural networks in time series data, learns and classifies the features selected by the convolutional neural network, and verifies the applicability based on binary classification and multi-classification scenarios. The model is trained using KDD CUP99, NSL_KDD, and UNSW_NB15 classic datasets. The verification accuracy and training loss on the three datasets all show good convergence and level, and the accuracy rate is high when classifying various types of traffic. The overall performance of NIDS-CNNLSTM has been significantly improved compared with the models proposed in previous studies. The effectiveness shows a high detection rate and classification accuracy and a low false alarm rate through experimental results. It is more suitable for large-scale and multi-scenario network data in the IIoT."

A recent paradigm, called shapelets, represents patterns that are highly predictive for the target variable. Shapelets are discovered by measuring the prediction accuracy of a set of potential (shapelet) candidates. The candidates typically consist of all the segments of a dataset, therefore, the discovery of shapelets is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel method that avoids measuring the prediction accuracy of similar candidates in Euclidean distance space, through an online clustering pruning technique. In addition, our algorithm incorporates a supervised shapelet selection that filters out only those candidates that improve classification accuracy. Empirical evidence on 45 datasets from the UCR collection demonstrate that our method is 3-4 orders of magnitudes faster than the fastest existing shapelet-discovery method, while providing better prediction accuracy."

Since the global constraint has been introduced in speech community, many global constraint models have been proposed including Sakoe-Chiba (S-C) band, Itakura Paral- lelogram, and Ratanamahatana-Keogh (R-K) band. The R-K band is a general global constraint model that can rep- resent any global constraints with arbitrary shape and size effectively. However, we need a good learning algorithm to discover the most suitable set of R-K bands, and the current R-K band learning algorithm still suffers from an 'overfit- ting' phenomenon. In this paper, we propose two new learn- ing algorithms, i.e., band boundary extraction algorithm and iterative learning algorithm. The band boundary extraction is calculated from the bound of all possible warping paths in each class, and the iterative learning is adjusted from the original R-K band learning. We also use a Silhouette index, a well-known clustering validation technique, as a heuris- tic function, and the lower bound function, LB Keogh, to enhance the prediction speed. Twenty datasets, from the Workshop and Challenge on Time Series Classification, held in conjunction of the SIGKDD 2007, are used to evaluate our approach."

Objective: To perform time-trend analysis of the mortality rate from accidental falls in (1) the city of Florianópolis (2) the state of Santa Catarina and (3) Brazil. Method: A time-series study of data from the Sistema de Informação sobre Mortalidade (“the Mortality Information System”) was performed. The variation in mortality caused by accidental falls was estimated using the joinpoint regression method, based on the International Disease Classification (ICD-10), chapter XX, codes W00 to W15 and W17 to W19, from 1997 to 2010. Results: It was observed that in the most recent periods (2005/2008; 2002/2008; 2003/2008), there was a significant increase in mortality rates related to accidental falls in all three regions, and that these rates increased with advancing age. Conclusion: Strategies to prevent accidental falls among the elderly should be aimed, mainly, at those who are 80 and over, the age in which accidental falls result in higher death rates. http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1809-9823.2015.14202"

However, one faces multiple challenges when analyzing clinical gene expression data; most of the well-known theoretical issues such as high dimension of feature spaces versus few examples, noise and missing data apply. Special care is needed when designing classification procedures that support personalized diagnosis and choice of treatment. Here, we particularly focus on classification of interferon-β (IFNβ) treatment response in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients which has attracted substantial attention in the recent past. Half of the patients remain unaffected by IFNβ treatment, which is still the standard. For them the treatment should be timely ceased to mitigate the side effects. Results: We propose constrained estimation of mixtures of hidden Markov models as a methodology to classify patient response to IFNβ treatment. The advantages of our approach are that it takes the temporal nature of the data into account and its robustness with respect to noise, missing data and mislabeled samples. Moreover, mixture estimation enables to explore the presence of response sub-groups of patients on the transcriptional level. We clearly outperformed all prior approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, raising it, for the first time, >90%. Additionally, we were able to identify potentially mislabeled samples and to sub-divide the good responders into two sub-groups that exhibited different transcriptional response programs. This is supported by recent findings on MS pathology and therefore may raise interesting clinical follow-up questions.

The stochastic process y(\cdot) is assumed to obey an autoregressive structure involving a parameter vector \theta , whose probability density p(\theta|C_{i}) depends on the class to which Z or y(\cdot) belongs. Assuming appropriate expressions for p(\theta|C_{i}) , it is shown that the probability density of Z_{N} characterizing each class, namely p(Z_{N}|C_{i}) , possesses a vector \bar{\theta} of sufficient statistics, i.e., all the information about Z_{N} needed for the discrimination between the various classes is contained in the vector \bar{\theta}=(\bar{\theta}_{1}(Z_{N}), \cdots , \bar{\theta}_{m+1}(Z_{N}))^{T} , where the functions \bar{\theta}_{i}(Z_{N}), i=1, \cdots ,m+1 have the same structure for all N . Thus the best possible feature set for the problem is \bar{\theta} From this is deduced the optimal decision rule to minimize the average probability of error. The optimal feature set and the corresponding optimal decision rule are compared with other feature sets and decision rules mentioned in the literature on speech recognition."

There are, in particular, large areas within southern Africa savanna ecosystems that lack consistent geospatial data on vegetation morphological properties, which is a prerequisite for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of ecological resources. Given the challenges involved in distinguishing and mapping savanna vegetation assemblages using remote sensing, the objective of this study was to develop a vegetation morphology map for the largest protected area in Africa, the central Kalahari. Six vegetation morphology classes were developed and sample training/validation pixels were selected for each class by analyzing extensive in situ data on vegetation structural and functional properties, in combination with existing ancillary data and coarse scale land cover products. The classification feature set consisted of annual and intra annual matrices derived from 14 years of satellite-derived vegetation indices images, and final classification was achieved using an ensemble tree based classifier. All vegetation morphology classes were mapped with high accuracy and the overall classification accuracy was 91.9%. Besides filling the geospatial data gap for the central Kalahari area, this vegetation morphology map is expected to serve as a critical input to ecological studies focusing on habitat use by wildlife and the efficacy of game fencing, as well as contributing to sustainable ecosystem management in the central Kalahari."

The Spatial Synoptic Classification is a useful tool for assessing weather effects on health because it considers the combined effect of meteorological factors rather than temperature only. The aim of this study was to assess the association between oppressive weather types and daily total mortality in Sweden. Time-series Poisson regression with distributed lags was used to assess the relationship between oppressive weather (Dry Polar, Dry Tropical, Moist Polar, and Moist Tropical) and daily deaths over 14 days in the extended summer (May to September), and 28 days during the extended winter (November to March), from 1991 to 2014. Days not classified as oppressive weather served as the reference category. We computed relative risks with 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for trends and seasonality. Results of the southern (Skåne and Stockholm) and northern (Jämtland and Västerbotten) locations were pooled using meta-analysis for regional-level estimates. Analyses were performed using the dlnm and mvmeta packages in R. During summer, in the South, the Moist Tropical and Dry Tropical weather types increased the mortality at lag 0 through lag 3 and lag 6, respectively. Moist Polar weather was associated with mortality at longer lags. In the North, Dry Tropical weather increased the mortality at shorter lags. During winter, in the South, Dry Polar and Moist Polar weather increased mortality from lag 6 to lag 10 and from lag 19 to lag 26, respectively. No effect of oppressive weather was found in the North. The effect of oppressive weather types in Sweden varies across seasons and regions.

Accurate information about land cover affects the accuracy of all subsequent applications, therefore accurate and timely land cover information is in high demand. In land cover classification studies over the past decade, higher accuracies were produced when using time series satellite images than when using single date images. Recently, the availability of the Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based computing platform, has gained the attention of remote sensing based applications where temporal aggregation methods derived from time series images are widely applied (i.e., the use the metrics such as mean or median), instead of time series images. In GEE, many studies simply select as many images as possible to fill gaps without concerning how different year/season images might affect the classification accuracy. This study aims to analyze the effect of different composition methods, as well as different input images, on the classification results. We use Landsat 8 surface reflectance (L8sr) data with eight different combination strategies to produce and evaluate land cover maps for a study area in Mongolia. We implemented the experiment on the GEE platform with a widely applied algorithm, the Random Forest (RF) classifier. Our results show that all the eight datasets produced moderately to highly accurate land cover maps, with overall accuracy over 84.31%. Among the eight datasets, two time series datasets of summer scenes (images from 1 June to 30 September) produced the highest accuracy (89.80% and 89.70%), followed by the median composite of the same input images (88.74%). The difference between these three classifications was not significant based on the McNemar test (p > 0.05). However, significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed for all other pairs involving one of these three datasets. The results indicate that temporal aggregation (e.g., median) is a promising method, which not only significantly reduces data volume (resulting in an easier and faster analysis) but also produces an equally high accuracy as time series data. The spatial consistency among the classification results was relatively low compared to the general high accuracy, showing that the selection of the dataset used in any classification on GEE is an important and crucial step, because the input images for the composition play an essential role in land cover classification, particularly with snowy, cloudy and expansive areas like Mongolia."

The primary objective of this research was to detect anthropogenic forest disturbance for a recent Landsat time series. A novel combination of an autonomous change detection procedure and spectral classification scheme was applied and tested in a landscape that has undergone significant resource development over the last 30 years. Anthropogenic disturbance was detected with greater than 93% accuracy. Most disturbances were correctly classified as within ±1 year. The signal of anthropogenic disturbance was significant in the landscape, accounting for more than 91% of all disturbances and 86% of total disturbed area during the 23-year study period. The study demonstrated a robust approach for examining historical disturbance trends related to human-modification of the environment."

In this paper, a dimension-combination method is proposed to search similar sequences for MTS. Firstly, the similarity of single-dimension series is calculated; then the overall similarity of the MTS is obtained by synthesizing each of the single-dimension similarity based on weighted BORDA voting method. The dimension-combination method could use the existing similarity searching method. Several experiments, which used the classification accuracy as a measure, were performed on six datasets from the UCI KDD Archive to validate the method. The results show the advantage of the approach compared to the traditional similarity measures, such as Euclidean distance (ED), cynamic time warping (DTW), point distribution (PD), PCA similarity factor (SPCA), and extended Frobenius norm (Eros), for MTS datasets in some ways.

The Planetscope (PS) constellation of more than 130 nanosatellites from Planet Labs revolutionize the high-resolution vegetation assessment. PS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps are one of the highest resolution data that can transform agricultural practices and management on a large scale. High-resolution PS nanosatellite data was utilized in the current study to monitor agriculture’s spatiotemporal assessment for the Al-Qassim region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The time series of NDVI was utilized to assess the vegetation pattern change in the study area. The current study area has sparse vegetation, and exposed soil exhibits brightness due to low soil moisture, constraining NDVI. Therefore, a machine learning (ML) based Random Forest (RF) classification model was used to compare the vegetation extent and computational cost of NDVI. The RF model has been compared with NDVI in the current investigation. It is one of the most precise classification methods because it can model the complexity of input variables, handle outliers, treat noise effectively, and avoid overfitting. Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) was implemented to compare the performance of both NDVI and RFbased classification. RF model provided good accuracy (98%) for all vegetation classes based on user accuracy, producer accuracy, and kappa coefficient."

Classification of electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) is a crucial non-invasive application in brain–computer interface (BCI) research. This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for accurate and robust EEG-based MI classification that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Approach. The proposed CNN model, namely EEG-inception, is built on the backbone of the inception-time network, which has showed to be highly efficient and accurate for time-series classification. Also, the proposed network is an end-to-end classification, as it takes the raw EEG signals as the input and does not require complex EEG signal-preprocessing. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method for EEG signals to enhance the accuracy, at least by 3%, and reduce overfitting with limited BCI datasets. Main results. The proposed model outperforms all state-of-the-art methods by achieving the average accuracy of 88.4% and 88.6% on the 2008 BCI Competition IV 2a (four-classes) and 2b datasets (binary-classes), respectively. Furthermore, it takes less than 0.025 s to test a sample suitable for real-time processing. Moreover, the classification standard deviation for nine different subjects achieves the lowest value of 5.5 for the 2b dataset and 7.1 for the 2a dataset, which validates that the proposed method is highly robust. Significance. From the experiment results, it can be inferred that the EEG-inception network exhibits a strong potential as a subject-independent classifier for EEG-based MI tasks."

By the recent arrival of the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 series, available free, processing and methods of analysis must be increased more and more in the field of cartography. This paper aims to present vegetation mapping method in the Pays de Brest area by using a time series stacking of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 satellites data using the algorithm Random Forest supervised classification. The types of vegetation mapping in first time are those belonging to the major vegetation types, but especially those that can be observed on the processed images that are the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 series and SPOT-6. The types of classes considered for this study are: no vegetation, forest and undergrowth, moors and lawns, summer crops, winter crops, grassland and water. Several time series stacking has been made on that series containing 140 images radar representing different dates (2017) and the best combination method is to use both the two polarizations VV and VH to the calculation of the matrix of confusion. On the other hand, combinations of SAR images with different vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, S2rep, IRECI) calculated from the Images Sentinel-2 have been made. The series of times series stacking ends with combinations between SPOT-6 and Sentinel-1. The times series stacking Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 are satisfactory, with an overall accuracy that reaches 93%. Such precision is very good for data that are available free."

In order to mitigate this problem, a combined discrete Fourier transform and fuzzy (CDFTF) based algorithm has been proposed in this paper. This method has been tested on a 400 km, 735 kV series compensated transmission line network and WSCC 3-machine 9-bus system for all fault types using MATLAB/Simulink and PSCAD platforms, respectively. A fixed series capacitor is located at the middle of the protected line. The fundamental components of phase currents, phase voltages, and zero-sequence current are fed as inputs to the proposed scheme. The fault detection, faulty phase selection, and fault classification are achieved within 1/2–1 cycle of power frequency. The proposed CDFTF-based scheme is less complex and is better than other data mining techniques which require huge training and testing time. Test results corroborate the proposed scheme reliability with wide variations in fault location, fault resistance, fault inception angle, evolving faults, compensation level, and heavy load interconnection. The results discussed in this work indicate that the proposed technique is resilient to wide variations in fault and system conditions."

Eyer,2022.0,31,[],"Gaia DR3 contains 1.8 billion sources with G-band photometry, 1.5 billion of which with BP and RP photometry, complemented by positions on the sky, parallax, and proper motion. The median number of field-of-view transits in the three photometric bands is between 40 and 44 measurements per source and covers 34 months of data collection. We pursue a classification of Galactic and extra-galactic objects that are detected as variable by Gaia across the whole sky. Supervised machine learning (eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest) was employed to generate multi-class, binary, and meta-classifiers that classified variable objects with photometric time series in the G, BP, and RP bands. Classification results comprise 12.4 million sources (selected from a much larger set of potential variable objects) and include about 9 million variable stars classified into 22 variability types in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds and Andromeda, plus thousands of supernova explosions in distant galaxies, 1 million active galactic nuclei, and almost 2.5 million galaxies. The identification of galaxies was made possible by the artificial variability of extended objects as detected by Gaia, so they were published in the galaxy_candidates table of the Gaia DR3 archive, separate from the classifications of genuine variability (in the vari_classifier_result table). The latter contains 24 variability classes or class groups of periodic and non-periodic variables (pulsating, eclipsing, rotating, eruptive, cataclysmic, stochastic, and microlensing), with amplitudes from a few milli-magnitudes to several magnitudes."

Sen4AgriNet dataset is annotated from farmer declarations collected via the land parcel identification system (LPIS) for harmonizing country-wide labels. These declarations have only recently been made available as open data, allowing for the first time the labeling of satellite imagery from ground truth data. We proceed to propose and standardize a new crop type taxonomy across Europe that addresses common agriculture policy (CAP) needs, based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicative crop classification scheme. Sen4AgriNet is the only multicountry, multiyear dataset that includes all spectral information. It is constructed to cover the period 2016–2020 for Catalonia and France, while it can be extended to include additional countries. Currently, it contains 42.5 million parcels, which makes it significantly larger than other available archives. We extract two subdatasets to highlight its value for diverse deep learning applications—the object aggregated dataset (OAD) and the patches assembled dataset (PAD). OAD capitalizes zonal statistics of each parcel, thus creating a powerful label-to-features instance for classification algorithms. On the other hand, PAD structure generalizes the classification problem to parcel extraction and semantic segmentation and labeling. The PAD and OAD are examined under three different scenarios to showcase and model the effects of spatial and temporal variability across different years and different countries.1"

It is estimated that in EU countries the number of people affected by drought was increased by 20% over the last decades. It is widely recognized that the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) can effectively provide drought characteristics in time and space. The paper questions the standard approach to estimate the SPI based on the Gamma probability distribution function, assessing the fitting performance of different biparametric distribution laws to monthly precipitation data. We estimate SPI time series, for different scale of temporal aggregation, on an unprecedented dataset consisting of 332 rain gauge stations deployed across Italy with observations recorded between 1951 and 2000. Results show that the Lognormal distribution performs better than the Gamma in fitting the monthly precipitation data at all time scales, affecting drought characteristics estimated from SPI signals. However, drought events detected using the original and the best fitting approaches does not diverge consistently in terms of return period. This suggests that the SPI in its original formulation can be applied for a reliable detection of drought events and for promoting mitigation strategies over the Italian peninsula."

We reviewed the success of considering vegetation dynamics in the most influential ecological forest classifications in Russia, the European Union, and North America. Out of the variety of approaches to forest classification, only those that are widely used in forestry and forest inventory were selected. It was found that the system of diagnostic signs developed by genetic forest typology based on the time-stable characteristics of habitats as well as the developed concept of dynamic series of cenosis formation allows us to successfully take into account the dynamics of vegetation. While forest dynamics in European classifications is assessed at a theoretical level, it is also possible to assess forest dynamics in practice due to information obtained from EUNIS habitat classification. In ecological classifications in North America, the problem of vegetation dynamics is most fully solved with ecological site description (ESD), which includes potential vegetation and disturbance factors in the classification features. In habitat type classification (HTC) and biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification (BEC), vegetation dynamics is accounted based on testing the diagnostic species and other signs of potential vegetation for resistance to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Understanding of vegetation–environment associations is fundamental in forming proper forest management methods and improving existing classification structures. We believe that this topic is relevant as part of the ongoing search for new solutions within all significant forest ecological classifications."
