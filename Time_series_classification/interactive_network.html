However, speed and data reduction are equally important in many applications, especially when the data scale and storage requirements rapidly increase. Current multivariate time series classification (MTSC) algorithms need hundreds of compute hours to complete training and prediction. This is due to the nature of multivariate time series data which grows with the number of time series, their length and the number of channels. In many applications, not all the channels are useful for the classification task, hence we require methods that can efficiently select useful channels and thus save computational resources. We propose and evaluate two methods for channel selection. Our techniques work by representing each class by a prototype time series and performing channel selection based on the prototype distance between classes. The main hypothesis is that useful channels enable better separation between classes; hence, channels with a larger distance between class prototypes are more useful. On the UEA MTSC benchmark, we show that these techniques achieve significant data reduction and classifier speedup for similar levels of classification accuracy. Channel selection is applied as a pre-processing step before training state-of-the-art MTSC algorithms and saves about 70% of computation time and data storage with preserved accuracy.

However, speed and data reduction are equally important in many applications, especially when the data scale and storage requirements rapidly increase. Current multivariate time series classification (MTSC) algorithms need hundreds of compute hours to complete training and prediction. This is due to the nature of multivariate time series data which grows with the number of time series, their length and the number of channels. In many applications, not all the channels are useful for the classification task, hence we require methods that can efficiently select useful channels and thus save computational resources. We propose and evaluate two methods for channel selection. Our techniques work by representing each class by a prototype time series and performing channel selection based on the prototype distance between classes. The main hypothesis is that useful channels enable better separation between classes; hence, channels with a larger distance between class prototypes are more useful. On the UEA MTSC benchmark, we show that these techniques achieve significant data reduction and classifier speedup for similar levels of classification accuracy. Channel selection is applied as a pre-processing step before training state-of-the-art MTSC algorithms and saves about 70% of computation time and data storage with preserved accuracy. Furthermore, our methods enable efficient classifiers, such as ROCKET, to achieve better accuracy than using no selection or greedy forward channel selection. To further study the impact of our techniques, we present experiments on classifying synthetic multivariate time series datasets with more than 100 channels, as well as a real-world case study on a dataset with 50 channels. In both cases, our channel selection methods result in significant data reduction with preserved or improved accuracy.\u003c/div\u003e"}, {"abstract": "A recent experimental evaluation assessed 19 time series classification (TSC) algorithms and found that one was significantly more accurate than all others: the Flat Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (Flat-COTE).

Based on mWDN, we further propose two deep learning models called Residual Classification Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) for time series classification and forecasting, respectively. The two models take all or partial mWDN decomposed sub-series in different frequencies as input, and resort to the back propagation algorithm to learn all the parameters globally, which enables seamless embedding of wavelet-based frequency analysis into deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR datasets and a real-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our time series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance analysis method to mWDN based models, which successfully identifies those time-series elements and mWDN layers that are crucially important to time series analysis.

In light of this, in this paper we propose a wavelet-based neural network structure called multilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for building frequency-aware deep learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves the advantage of multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while enables the fine-tuning of all parameters under a deep neural network framework. Based on mWDN, we further propose two deep learning models called Residual Classification Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) for time series classification and forecasting, respectively. The two models take all or partial mWDN decomposed sub-series in different frequencies as input, and resort to the back propagation algorithm to learn all the parameters globally, which enables seamless embedding of wavelet-based frequency analysis into deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR datasets and a real-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our time series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance analysis method to mWDN based models, which successfully identifies those time-series elements and mWDN layers that are crucially important to time series analysis. This indeed indicates the interpretability advantage of mWDN, and can be viewed as an indepth exploration to interpretable deep learning.\u003c/div\u003e"}, {"abstract": "Existing approaches to time series classification can be grouped into shape-based (numeric) and structure-based (symbolic). Shape-based techniques use the raw numeric time series with Euclidean or Dynamic Time Warping distance and a 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier. They are accurate, but computationally intensive. Structure-based methods discretize the raw data into symbolic representations, then extract features for classifiers. Recent symbolic methods have outperformed numeric ones regarding both accuracy and efficiency. Most approaches employ a bag-of-symbolic-words representation, but typically the word-length is fixed across all time series, an issue identified as a major weakness in the literature. Also, there are no prior attempts to use efficient sequence learning techniques to go beyond single words, to features based on variable-length sequences of words or symbols. We study an efficient linear classification approach, SEQL, originally designed for classification of symbolic sequences. SEQL learns discriminative subsequences from training data by exploiting the all-subsequence space using greedy gradient descent. We explore different discretization approaches, from none at all to increasing smoothing of the original data, and study the effect of these transformations on the accuracy of SEQL classifiers.

Recently, there are some attempts to leverage such order information to first pre-train time-series models by reconstructing time-series values of randomly masked time segments, followed by an end-task fine-tuning on the same dataset, demonstrating improved end-task performance. However, this learning paradigm decouples data reconstruction from the end task. We argue that the representations learnt in this way are not informed by the end task and may, therefore, be sub-optimal for the end-task performance. In fact, the importance of different timestamps can vary significantly in different end tasks. We believe that representations learnt by reconstructing important timestamps would be a better strategy for improving end-task performance. In this work, we propose TARNet, Task-Aware Reconstruction Network, a new model using Transformers to learn task-aware data reconstruction that augments end-task performance. Specifically, we design a data-driven masking strategy that uses self-attention score distribution from end-task training to sample timestamps deemed important by the end task.

Recently, there are some attempts to leverage such order information to first pre-train time-series models by reconstructing time-series values of randomly masked time segments, followed by an end-task fine-tuning on the same dataset, demonstrating improved end-task performance. However, this learning paradigm decouples data reconstruction from the end task. We argue that the representations learnt in this way are not informed by the end task and may, therefore, be sub-optimal for the end-task performance. In fact, the importance of different timestamps can vary significantly in different end tasks. We believe that representations learnt by reconstructing important timestamps would be a better strategy for improving end-task performance. In this work, we propose TARNet, Task-Aware Reconstruction Network, a new model using Transformers to learn task-aware data reconstruction that augments end-task performance. Specifically, we design a data-driven masking strategy that uses self-attention score distribution from end-task training to sample timestamps deemed important by the end task. Then, we mask out data at those timestamps and reconstruct them, thereby making the reconstruction task-aware. This reconstruction task is trained alternately with the end task at every epoch, sharing parameters in a single model, allowing the representation learnt through reconstruction to improve end-task performance.

The key idea is to transform numerical time series to symbolic representations in the time or frequency domain, i.e., sequences of symbols, and then extract features from these sequences. While achieving high accuracy, existing symbolic classifiers are computationally expensive. It is also not clear whether further accuracy and speed improvements could be gained by a careful analysis of the symbolic transform and the trade-offs between time domain and frequency domain symbolic features. In this paper we present MrSQM, a new time series classifier that uses multiple symbolic representations and efficient sequence mining, to extract important time series features. We study two symbolic transforms and four feature selection approaches on symbolic sequences, ranging from fully supervised, to unsupervised and hybrids. We propose a new approach for optimal supervised symbolic feature selection in all-subsequence space, by adapting a Chi-squared bound developed for discriminative pattern mining, to time series. Our experiments on the 112 datasets of the UEA/UCR benchmark demonstrate that MrSQM can quickly extract useful features and learn accurate classifiers with the logistic regression algorithm. We show that a fast symbolic transform combined with a simple feature selection strategy can be highly effective as compared to more sophisticated and expensive feature selection methods.

The key idea is to transform numerical time series to symbolic representations in the time or frequency domain, i.e., sequences of symbols, and then extract features from these sequences. While achieving high accuracy, existing symbolic classifiers are computationally expensive. It is also not clear whether further accuracy and speed improvements could be gained by a careful analysis of the symbolic transform and the trade-offs between time domain and frequency domain symbolic features. In this paper we present MrSQM, a new time series classifier that uses multiple symbolic representations and efficient sequence mining, to extract important time series features. We study two symbolic transforms and four feature selection approaches on symbolic sequences, ranging from fully supervised, to unsupervised and hybrids. We propose a new approach for optimal supervised symbolic feature selection in all-subsequence space, by adapting a Chi-squared bound developed for discriminative pattern mining, to time series. Our experiments on the 112 datasets of the UEA/UCR benchmark demonstrate that MrSQM can quickly extract useful features and learn accurate classifiers with the logistic regression algorithm. We show that a fast symbolic transform combined with a simple feature selection strategy can be highly effective as compared to more sophisticated and expensive feature selection methods.
