Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is an important symptom that needs to be 
quantified, but there is confusion over the best way to do this. Three of the 
most commonly used tests: the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), the 
maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) 
give results that are significantly correlated in a statistical sense, but are 
not closely related. The purpose of this investigation was to help clarify this 
problem. Previously published data from several investigations were used to 
calculate the reference range of normal values for each test, defined by the 
mean+/-2 SD or by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. The 'rule of thumb' that many 
people rely on to interpret MSLT results is shown here to be misleading. 
Previously published results from each test were also available for narcoleptic 
patients who were drug-free at the time and who by definition had EDS. This 
enabled the sensitivity and specificity of the three tests to be compared for 
the first time, in their ability to distinguish the EDS of narcolepsy from the 
daytime sleepiness of normal subjects. The receiver operator characteristic 
curves clearly showed that the ESS is the most discriminating test, the MWT is 
next best and the MSLT the least discriminating test of daytime sleepiness. The 
MSLT can no longer be considered the gold standard for such tests.

Hypocretins (orexins) are hypothalamic neuropeptides involved in sleep and 
energy homeostasis. Hypocretin mutations produce narcolepsy in animal models. In 
humans, narcolepsy is rarely due to hypocretin mutations, but this system is 
deficient in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain of a small number of 
patients. A recent study also indicates increased body mass index (BMI) in 
narcolepsy. The sensitivity of low CSF hypocretin was examined in 38 successive 
narcolepsy-cataplexy cases [36 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*0602-positive] 
and 34 matched controls (15 controls and 19 neurological patients). BMI and CSF 
leptin levels were also measured. Hypocretin-1 was measurable (169 to 376 pg/ml) 
in all controls. Levels were unaffected by freezing/thawing or prolonged storage 
and did not display any concentration gradient. Hypocretin-1 was dramatically 
decreased (<100 pg/ml) in 32 of 38 patients (all HLA-positive). Four patients 
had normal levels (2 HLA-negative). Two HLA-positive patients had high levels 
(609 and 637 pg/ml). CSF leptin and adjusted BMI were significantly higher in 
patients versus controls. We conclude that the hypocretin ligand is deficient in 
most cases of human narcolepsy, providing possible diagnostic applications. 
Increased BMI and leptin indicate altered energy homeostasis. Sleep and energy 
metabolism are likely to be functionally connected through the hypocretin 
system.

Narcolepsy with cataplexy, characterized by sleepiness and rapid onset into REM 
sleep, affects 1 in 2,000 individuals. Narcolepsy was first shown to be tightly 
associated with HLA-DR2 (ref. 3) and later sublocalized to DQB1*0602 (ref. 4). 
Following studies in dogs and mice, a 95% loss of hypocretin-producing cells in 
postmortem hypothalami from narcoleptic individuals was reported. Using 
genome-wide association (GWA) in Caucasians with replication in three ethnic 
groups, we found association between narcolepsy and polymorphisms in the TRA@ 
(T-cell receptor alpha) locus, with highest significance at rs1154155 (average 
allelic odds ratio 1.69, genotypic odds ratios 1.94 and 2.55, P < 10(-21), 1,830 
cases, 2,164 controls). This is the first documented genetic involvement of the 
TRA@ locus, encoding the major receptor for HLA-peptide presentation, in any 
disease. It is still unclear how specific HLA alleles confer susceptibility to 
over 100 HLA-associated disorders; thus, narcolepsy will provide new insights on 
how HLA-TCR interactions contribute to organ-specific autoimmune targeting and 
may serve as a model for over 100 other HLA-associated disorders.

Seventy-five patients meeting international diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy 
enrolled in a 6-week, three-period, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled 
trial. Patients received placebo, modafinil 200 mg, or modafinil 400 mg in 
divided doses (morning and noon). Evaluations occurred at baseline and at the 
end of each 2-week period. Compared with placebo, modafinil 200 and 400 mg 
significantly increased the mean sleep latency on the Maintenance of Wakefulness 
Test by 40% and 54%, with no significant difference between the two doses. 
Modafinil, 200 and 400 mg, also reduced the combined number of daytime sleep 
episodes and periods of severe sleepiness noted in sleep logs. The likelihood of 
falling asleep as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was equally reduced 
by both modafinil dose levels. There were no effects on nocturnal sleep 
initiation, maintenance, or architecture, nor were there any effects on sleep 
apnea or periodic leg movements. Neither dose interfered with the patients' 
ability to nap voluntarily during the day nor with their quantity or quality of 
nocturnal sleep. Modafinil produced no changes in blood pressure or heart rate 
in either normotensive or hypertensive patients. The only significant adverse 
effects were seen at the 400-mg dose, which was associated with more nausea and 
more nervousness than either placebo or the 200-mg dose. As little as a 200-mg 
daily dose of modafinil is therefore an effective and well-tolerated treatment 
of excessive daytime somnolence in narcoleptic persons.

BACKGROUND: Narcolepsy usually starts around adolescence; however, there is 
great variability in the clinical presentation of narcolepsy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the age at onset in conjunction with severity of 
narcoleptic symptoms in two large populations of narcoleptic patients with a 
similar genetic background.
METHODS: Information on age at onset and severity of the condition was obtained 
in 317 patients with well-defined narcolepsy-cataplexy from Montpellier (France) 
and in 202 from Montreal (Canada).
RESULTS: The mean age at onset was 23.4 years in Montpellier and 24.4 in 
Montreal. The age at onset was bimodal in two independent patient populations: a 
first peak occurring at 14.7 years, and a second peak occurring at 35. Age at 
onset clearly differentiates patients with a positive family history of 
narcolepsy (early onset) from those without a family history. Other clinical and 
polygraphic findings may indicate that young age at onset is associated with 
increased severity of the condition (higher frequency of cataplexy and decreased 
mean sleep latency on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test).
CONCLUSION: Bimodal distribution of age at onset of narcolepsy was found in two 
independent patient populations. Our data suggest that age at onset is 
genetically determined.

Narcolepsy in which the hallucinatory component is unusually prominent may lead 
to the development of an illness indistinguishable from the schizophrenic 
syndrome. Psychotic symptoms dominate the symptomatology, so that the primary 
illness is obscured. Five patients are described for whom conventional 
antipsychotic drugs were ineffectual, but for whom treatment with stimulants 
produced substantial improvement. The diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by 
Human Leukocyte Antigen typing and sleep laboratory testing. These results 
support the ""REM intrusion"" hypothesis of the causation of schizophrenia in as 
many as 7% of a series of schizophrenic patients. Implications for diagnosis and 
treatment are discussed.

Recent advances in the identification of susceptibility genes and environmental 
exposures provide broad support for a post-infectious autoimmune basis for 
narcolepsy/hypocretin (orexin) deficiency. We genotyped loci associated with 
other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in 1,886 individuals with 
hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy and 10,421 controls, all of European ancestry, 
using a custom genotyping array (ImmunoChip). Three loci located outside the 
Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6 were significantly 
associated with disease risk. In addition to a strong signal in the T cell 
receptor alpha (TRA@), variants in two additional narcolepsy loci, Cathepsin H 
(CTSH) and Tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily member 4 (TNFSF4, also 
called OX40L), attained genome-wide significance. These findings underline the 
importance of antigen presentation by HLA Class II to T cells in the 
pathophysiology of this autoimmune disease.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to compare severity and 
clinical presentation for narcolepsy-cataplexy across various ethnic groups. A 
large sample of narcoleptic patients was also used to further describe 
symptomatology and natural history for this sleep disorder.
DESIGN: Retrospective review of clinical data ascertained from the Stanford 
Sleep Inventory, polysomnography and MSLT data, as well as clinical notes. 
Ethnicity was narrowly defined as African (Black) Americans, Caucasians, Asians, 
and Latinos when both parents and the subject identified with a given ethnic 
group.
SETTING: N/A.
PARTICIPANTS: We compared the severity and clinical presentation of narcolepsy 
in 64 African Americans, 353 Caucasians, 32 Asians, 26 Latinos, and 9 subjects 
of mixed ethnicity. Subjects were recruited through the Stanford center for 
narcolepsy research.
INTERVENTIONS: N/A.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: A striking similarity in symptomatology, age of onset, 
and disease severity was found across ethnic groups. Mean age of onset for 
sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and cataplexy were 19.20, 
19.50, 20.11 and 23.02 years old. We also found that narcoleptic patients have 
slightly but significantly elevated body mass index relative to normative data 
(106.6% of matched controls, p<0.005) and are born slightly more frequently 
during the month of March. A tight correlation between our previously validated 
cataplexy scale and DQB1*0602 positivity was observed. Two thirds of patients 
reported having cataplexy with laughing, 92% of those being DQB1*0602 positive 
independent of ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the similarities in clinical presentation and 
natural history of narcolepsy-cataplexy in a large number of patients of various 
ethnic groups and cultural backgrounds.

Management of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy relies on several classes of 
drugs, namely stimulants for excessive daytime sleepiness and irresistible 
episodes of sleep, antidepressants for cataplexy and hypnosedative drugs for 
disturbed nocturnal sleep. In addition, behavioral measures can be of notable 
value. Guidelines on the management of narcolepsy have already been published. 
However contemporary guidelines are necessary given the growing use of modafinil 
to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in Europe within the last 5-10 years, and 
the decreasing need for amphetamines and amphetamine-like stimulants; the 
extensive use of new antidepressants in the treatment of cataplexy, apart from 
consistent randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials; and the present 
re-emergence of gamma-hydroxybutyrate under the name sodium oxybate, as a 
treatment of all major symptoms of narcolepsy. A task force composed of the 
leading specialists of narcolepsy in Europe has been appointed. This task force 
conducted an extensive review of pharmacological and behavioral trials available 
in the literature. All trials were analyzed according to their class evidence. 
Recommendations concerning the treatment of each single symptom of narcolepsy as 
well as general recommendations were made. Modafinil is the first-line 
pharmacological treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and irresistible 
episodes of sleep in association with behavioral measures. However, based on 
several large randomized controlled trials showing the activity of sodium 
oxybate, not only on cataplexy but also on excessive daytime sleepiness and 
irresistible episodes of sleep, there is a growing practice in the USA to use it 
for the later indications. Given the availability of modafinil and 
methylphenidate, and the forseen registration of sodium oxybate for narcolepsy 
(including excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, disturbed nocturnal sleep) 
in Europe, the place of other compounds will become fairly limited. Since its 
recent registration cataplexy sodium oxybate has now become the first-line 
treatment of cataplexy. Second-line treatments are antidepressants, either 
tricyclics or newer antidepressants, the later being increasingly used these 
past years despite few or no randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. As 
for disturbed nocturnal sleep the best option is still hypnotics until sodium 
oxybate is registered for narcolepsy. The treatments used for narcolepsy, either 
pharmacological or behavioral, are diverse. However the quality of the published 
clinical evidences supporting them varies widely and studies comparing the 
efficacy of different substances are lacking. Several treatments are used on an 
empirical basis, specially antidepressants for cataplexy, due to the fact that 
these medications are already used widely in depressed patients, leaving little 
motivation from the manufacturers to investigate efficacy in relatively rare 
indications. Others, in particular the more recently developed substances, such 
as modafinil or sodium oxybate, are evaluated in large randomized 
placebo-controlled trials. Our objective was to reinforce the use of those drugs 
evaluated in randomized placebo-controlled trials and to reach a consensus, as 
much as possible, on the use of other available medications.

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterised by symptoms of excessive 
daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. The aim of this study was to describe the 
health-related quality of life of people with narcolepsy residing in the UK. The 
study comprised a postal survey of 500 members of the UK narcolepsy patient 
association, which included amongst other questions the UK Short Form 36 
(SF-36), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy 
Scale (UNS). A total of 305 questionnaires were included in the final analysis. 
The results showed that the subjects had significantly lower median scores on 
all eight domains of the SF-36 than normative data, and scored particularly 
poorly for the domains of role physical, energy/vitality, and social 
functioning. The BDI indicated that 56.9% of subjects had some degree of 
depression. In addition, many individuals described limitations on their 
education, home, work and social life caused by their symptoms. There was little 
difference between the groups receiving different types of medication. This 
study is the largest of its type in the UK, although the limitations of using a 
sample from a patient association have been recognised. The results are 
consistent with studies of narcolepsy in other countries in demonstrating the

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that has a typical onset in adolescence 
and is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, which can have severe 
consequences for the patient. Problems faced by patients with narcolepsy include 
social stigma associated with this disease, difficulties in obtaining an 
education and keeping a job, a reduced quality of life and socioeconomic 
consequences. Two subtypes of narcolepsy have been described (narcolepsy type 1 
and narcolepsy type 2), both of which have similar clinical profiles, except for 
the presence of cataplexy, which occurs only in patients with narcolepsy type 1. 
The pathogenesis of narcolepsy type 1 is hypothesized to be the autoimmune 
destruction of the hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus; this 
hypothesis is supported by immune-related genetic and environmental factors 
associated with the disease. However, direct evidence in support of the 
autoimmune hypothesis is currently unavailable. Diagnosis of narcolepsy 
encompasses clinical, electrophysiological and biological evaluations, but 
simpler and faster procedures are needed. Several medications are available for 
the symptomatic treatment of narcolepsy, all of which have quite good efficacy 
and safety profiles. However, to date, no treatment hinders or slows disease 
development. Improved diagnostic tools and increased understanding of the 
pathogenesis of narcolepsy type 1 are needed and might lead to therapeutic or 
even preventative interventions.

Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy 
and/or other dissociated manifestations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 
(hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis). Narcolepsy is currently treated 
with amphetamine-like central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (for EDS) and 
antidepressants (for cataplexy). Some other classes of compounds such as 
modafinil (a non-amphetamine wake-promoting compound for EDS) and 
gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB, a short-acting sedative for EDS/fragmented nighttime 
sleep and cataplexy) given at night are also employed. The major pathophysiology 
of human narcolepsy has been recently elucidated based on the discovery of 
narcolepsy genes in animals. Using forward (i.e., positional cloning in canine 
narcolepsy) and reverse (i.e., mouse gene knockout) genetics, the genes involved 
in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy (hypocretin/orexin ligand and its receptor) in 
animals have been identified. Hypocretins/orexins are novel hypothalamic 
neuropeptides also involved in various hypothalamic functions such as energy 
homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions. Mutations in hypocretin-related genes 
are rare in humans, but hypocretin-ligand deficiency is found in many 
narcolepsy-cataplexy cases. In this review, the clinical, pathophysiological and 
pharmacological aspects of narcolepsy are discussed.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: to report on symptoms and therapies used in childhood 
narcolepsy-cataplexy.
DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND SETTING: retrospective series of 51 children who completed 
the Stanford Sleep Inventory. HLA-DQB1*0602 typing (all tested, and 100% 
positive), polysomnography or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (76%), and 
cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 measurements (26%, all with low levels) were 
also conducted. Prospective data on medication response was collected in 78% 
using a specially designed questionnaire.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: patients were separated into children with onset of 
narcolepsy prior to (53%), around (29%), and after (18%) puberty. None of the 
children had secondary narcolepsy. Clinical features were similar across puberty 
groups, except for sleep paralysis, which increased in frequency with age. 
Common features included excessive weight gain (84% ≥ 4 kg within 6 months of 
onset of narcolepsy) and earlier puberty (when compared with family members), 
notably in subjects who gained the most weight. Streptococcus-positive throat 
infections were reported in 20% of cases within 6 months of onset of narcolepsy. 
Polysomnographic features were similar across groups, but 3 prepubertal children 
did not meet Multiple Sleep Latency Test diagnostic criteria. Regarding 
treatment, the most used and continued medications were modafinil (84% 
continued), sodium oxybate (79%), and venlafaxine (68%). Drugs such as 
methylphenidate, tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors were often tried but rarely continued. Modafinil was reported to be 
effective for treating sleepiness, venlafaxine for cataplexy, and sodium oxybate 
for all symptoms, across all puberty groups. At the conclusion of the study, 
half of children with prepubertal onset of narcolepsy were treated ""off label"" 
with sodium oxybate alone or with the addition of one other compound. In older 
children, however, most patients needed more than 2 drugs.
CONCLUSION: this study reports on the clinical features of childhood narcolepsy 
and documents the safe use of treatments commonly used in adults in young 
children.

IMPORTANCE: Narcolepsy, a disorder associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02 and caused by 
hypocretin (orexin) deficiency, is diagnosed using the Multiple Sleep Latency 
Test (MSLT) following nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG). In many patients, a 
short rapid eye movement sleep latency (REML) during the NPSG is also observed 
but not used diagnostically.
OBJECTIVE: To determine diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of nocturnal 
REML measures in narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study using receiver operating 
characteristic curves for NPSG REML and MSLT findings (sleep studies performed 
between May 1976 and September 2011 at university medical centers in the United 
States, China, Korea, and Europe) to determine optimal diagnostic cutoffs for 
narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency compared with different samples: controls, 
patients with other sleep disorders, patients with other hypersomnias, and 
patients with narcolepsy with normal hypocretin levels. Increasingly stringent 
comparisons were made. In a first comparison, 516 age- and sex-matched patients 
with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency were selected from 1749 patients and 
compared with 516 controls. In a second comparison, 749 successive patients 
undergoing sleep evaluation for any sleep disorders (low pretest probability for 
narcolepsy) were compared within groups by final diagnosis of 
narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. In the third comparison, 254 patients with a 
high pretest probability of having narcolepsy were compared within group by 
their final diagnosis. Finally, 118 patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin 
deficiency were compared with 118 age- and sex-matched patients with a diagnosis 
of narcolepsy but with normal hypocretin levels.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of NPSG REML and MSLT as 
diagnostic tests for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. This diagnosis was 
defined as narcolepsy associated with cataplexy plus HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity 
(no cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 results available) or narcolepsy with 
documented low (≤ 110 pg/mL) cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 level.
RESULTS: Short REML (≤15 minutes) during NPSG was highly specific (99.2% [95% 
CI, 98.5%-100.0%] of 516 and 99.6% [95% CI, 99.1%-100.0%] of 735) but not 
sensitive (50.6% [95% CI, 46.3%-54.9%] of 516 and 35.7% [95% CI, 10.6%-60.8%] of 
14) for patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency vs population-based 
controls or all patients with sleep disorders undergoing a nocturnal sleep study 
(area under the curve, 0.799 [95% CI, 0.771-0.826] and 0.704 [95% CI, 
0.524-0.907], respectively). In patients with central hypersomnia and thus a 
high pretest probability for narcolepsy, short REML remained highly specific 
(95.4% [95% CI, 90.4%-98.3%] of 132) and similarly sensitive (57.4% [95% CI, 
48.1%-66.3%] of 122) for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (area under the curve, 
0.765 [95% CI, 0.707-0.831]). Positive predictive value in this high pretest 
probability sample was 92.1% (95% CI, 83.6%-97.0%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients being evaluated for possible 
narcolepsy, short REML (≤15 minutes) at NPSG had high specificity and positive 
predictive value and may be considered diagnostic without the use of an MSLT; 
absence of short REML, however, requires a subsequent MSLT.

BACKGROUND: Individuals affected with narcolepsy represent a vulnerable segment 
of the population. However, we only have a partial understanding of this 
vulnerability. Our study aims to examine psychiatric disorders and medical 
conditions associated with narcolepsy.
METHODS: A total of 320 narcoleptic participants were interviewed regarding 
sleeping habits, health, medication consumption, medical conditions 
(International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, 10th edition), sleep disorders (International Classification of Sleep 
Disorders, second edition [ICSD-2]) and mental disorders (Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision 
[DSM-IV-TR]) using Sleep-EVAL. A general population comparison sample (N=1464) 
matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) and interviewed with the same 
instrument was used to estimate odds ratios (OR).
RESULTS: Five diseases were more frequently observed among narcoleptic 
participants, including hypercholesterolemia (OR, 1.51), diseases of the 
digestive system (OR, 3.27), heart diseases (OR, 2.07), upper respiratory tract 
diseases (OR, 2.52), and hypertension (OR, 1.32). Most frequent psychiatric 
disorders among the narcolepsy group were major depressive disorder (MDD) (OR, 
2.67) and social anxiety disorder (OR, 2.43), both affecting nearly 20% of 
narcoleptic individuals. However, most mood and anxiety disorders were more 
prevalent among the narcoleptic group. Alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence was 
comparable between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Narcolepsy is associated with a high comorbidity of both medical 
conditions and psychiatric disorders that need to be addressed when developing a 
treatment plan.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and PSG characteristics of 
narcolepsy with cataplexy and their genetic predisposition by using the 
retrospective patient database of the European Narcolepsy Network (EU-NN). We 
have analysed retrospective data of 1099 patients with narcolepsy diagnosed 
according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2. Demographic and 
clinical characteristics, polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test data, 
hypocretin-1 levels, and genome-wide genotypes were available. We found a 
significantly lower age at sleepiness onset (men versus women: 23.74 ± 12.43 
versus 21.49 ± 11.83, P = 0.003) and longer diagnostic delay in women (men 
versus women: 13.82 ± 13.79 versus 15.62 ± 14.94, P = 0.044). The mean 
diagnostic delay was 14.63 ± 14.31 years, and longer delay was associated with 
higher body mass index. The best predictors of short diagnostic delay were young 
age at diagnosis, cataplexy as the first symptom and higher frequency of 
cataplexy attacks. The mean multiple sleep latency negatively correlated with 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and with the number of sleep-onset rapid eye 
movement periods (SOREMPs), but none of the polysomnographic variables was 
associated with subjective or objective measures of sleepiness. Variant 
rs2859998 in UBXN2B gene showed a strong association (P = 1.28E-07) with the age 
at onset of excessive daytime sleepiness, and rs12425451 near the transcription 
factor TEAD4 (P = 1.97E-07) with the age at onset of cataplexy. Altogether, our 
results indicate that the diagnostic delay remains extremely long, age and 
gender substantially affect symptoms, and that a genetic predisposition affects 
the age at onset of symptoms.

BACKGROUND: There can be a long interval from the onset of symptoms before a 
diagnosis of narcolepsy is made. There are no multivariate analyses reported in 
the literature of factors that may contribute to this delay. The aims of this 
study were to describe the delay in diagnosis of people with narcolepsy living 
in the UK and to identify associated factors.
METHODS: The study comprised a postal survey of 500 members of the Narcolepsy 
Association UK, which included questions regarding age of onset of symptoms, 
year of diagnosis and subject demographics. Cox's proportional hazards 
regression was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 313 questionnaires were returned of which 219 had been 
completed sufficiently for analysis. The interval between symptom onset and 
diagnosis ranged from within 1 to 61 years with a median of 10.5 years. 
Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of cataplexy as one of the 
initial symptoms and a more recent year of symptom onset were the only factors 
associated with time to diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that the diagnosis of narcolepsy can be delayed 
for many years particularly when cataplexy is absent initially. The delay in 
diagnosis in the UK appears to be decreasing, probably through greater doctor 
and patient awareness of the clinical manifestations of narcolepsy.

Increased frequency of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus among narcoleptic 
patients.

Honda Y, Doi Y, Ninomiya R, Ninomiya C.

Forty-eight narcoleptic patients were randomly selected from a group of 197 
narcoleptic outpatients, and a 50-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was 
performed. Blood glucose levels were determined by oximetry before and 30, 60, 
and 120 min after the glucose administration. Serum insulin concentrations (IRI) 
were determined by enzyme immunoassay, and an insulinogenic index (II) was 
calculated. (II = the ratio of IRI increment to blood glucose increment in 30 
min following glucose load). From the results of the OGTT, six patients with 
definite diabetes mellitus (DM) were identified (12.5%, 4 men and 2 women) 
according to World Health Organization criteria (1980). The II of the DM 
patients was significantly low, with an average of 0.13 +/- 0.03. From recent 
data in the literature on the prevalence of DM in the general Japanese adult 
population (1.75-5.5%), it was concluded that the frequency of DM among our 
randomly selected narcoleptic patients was significantly increased. The positive 
results for diabetes in our six narcoleptic patients could not be attributed to 
obesity, because there was no difference between the obesity indices of DM and 
nonDM narcoleptic patients, nor was there a difference between the frequency of 
DM in obese and nonobese patients.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Characterize disrupted nighttime sleep (DNS) in narcolepsy, an 
important symptom of narcolepsy.
METHODS: A panel of international narcolepsy experts was convened in 2011 to 
build a consensus characterization of DNS in patients with narcolepsy. A 
literature search of the Medline (1965 to date), Medline In-Process (latest 
weeks), Embase (1974 to date), Embase Alert (latest 8 weeks), and Biosis (1965 
to date) databases was conducted using the following search terms: narcolepsy 
and disrupted nighttime sleep, disturbed nighttime sleep, fragmented sleep, 
consolidated sleep, sleep disruption, and narcolepsy questionnaire. The purpose 
of the literature search was to identify publications characterizing the 
nighttime sleep of patients with narcolepsy. The panel reviewed the literature. 
Nocturnal sleep can also be disturbed by REM sleep abnormalities such as vivid 
dreaming and REM sleep behavior disorder; however, these were not reviewed in 
the current paper, as we were evaluating for idiopathic sleep disturbances.
RESULTS: The literature reviewed provide a consistent characterization of 
nighttime sleep in patients with narcolepsy as fragmented, with reports of 
frequent, brief nightly awakenings with difficulties returning to sleep and 
associated reports of poor sleep quality. Polysomnographic studies consistently 
report frequent awakenings/arousals after sleep onset, more stage 1 (S1) sleep, 
and more frequent shifts to S1 sleep or wake from deeper stages of sleep. The 
consensus of the International Experts' Panel on Narcolepsy was that DNS can be 
distressing for patients with narcolepsy and that treatment of DNS warrants 
consideration.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians involved in the management of patients with narcolepsy 
should investigate patients' quality of nighttime sleep, give weight and 
consideration to patient reports of nighttime sleep experience, and consider DNS 
a target for treatment.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients 
suffering from narcolepsy.
METHODS: Subjects included 75 narcoleptic patients diagnosed at the Hephata 
Klinik, Germany, who met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 
(ICSD) criteria for narcolepsy. A standardized telephone interview was used to 
inquire about the disease and its burdens to the patients. HRQoL was recorded 
using the 36-item short-form Medical Outcomes Study (SF-36) as well as the 
Euroqol (EQ-5D). Frequency and factors of influence on decreased HRQoL were 
evaluated by using bivariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: Patients with narcolepsy had considerably lower scores on all eight 
domains of the SF-36 compared to the general German population. In particular, 
scores were poor for the dimensions ""physical role"", ""vitality"", and ""general 
health perception"". Forty-eight percent of the patients reported problems in at 
least one of the EQ-5D items; most frequent were problems in the dimension 
""usual activity"" (63.8%), ""pain/discomfort"" (61.7%) and ""anxiety/depression"" 
(41.1%). Difficulty maintaining ""self-care"" was documented only by 6.8%. The 
mean VAS score was 60.7%. Interestingly, signs and symptoms of narcolepsy, 
except for irresistible sleep episodes (p<0.03), had only a minor impact on 
HRQoL. Multivariate analyses confirmed a strong influence of employment status, 
living with a partner, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and professional 
advancement.
CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL is considerably reduced in patients, with narcolepsy 
affecting the different dimensions to various degrees. Factors other than 
clinical signs and symptoms are associated also with poor HRQoL. Measures should 
be taken to integrate those factors into healthcare guidelines in order to 
improve the quality of life in patients with narcolepsy.

Objective: To assess the continued efficacy of modafinil in the treatment of 
excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) of narcolepsy.Background: Modafinil has been 
shown to be a safe and effective treatment for the EDS presented by patients 
with narcolepsy. However, the duration of treatment has been relatively brief, 
particularly considering the chronic nature of the disease.Methods: Sixty-nine 
patients with narcolepsy, who completed a 6-week crossover study of modafinil 
continued on modafinil for 16 weeks of open-label treatment (300+/-100 mg). This 
was followed by 2 weeks during which patients were randomly and blindly 
allocated to continue modafinil (M) at the same dose (n=30), or placebo (P; 
n=33).Results: A mean dose of 330 mg of modafinil continued to produce a 
significant decrease in EDS as measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test 
(9.7+/-7.9 for P; 16.4+/-13.7 for M; P=0.009), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
(15.4+/-5.8 for P; 13.2+/-5.7 for M; P=0.023), and the number of episodes of 
severe somnolence and sleep reported in patient diaries (8.2+/-7.2 for P; 
4.2+/-5.2 for M; P=0.017). Modafinil had no significant effects on nocturnal 
sleep, blood pressure, heart rate, the electrocardiogram (ECG), weight, or 
mood.Conclusion: Modafinil continues to be an effective and well-tolerated drug 
after 16 weeks of treatment.

The development and use of a new scale, the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), is 
described. This is a simple, self-administered questionnaire which is shown to 
provide a measurement of the subject's general level of daytime sleepiness. One 
hundred and eighty adults answered the ESS, including 30 normal men and women as 
controls and 150 patients with a range of sleep disorders. They rated the 
chances that they would doze off or fall asleep when in eight different 
situations commonly encountered in daily life. Total ESS scores significantly 
distinguished normal subjects from patients in various diagnostic groups 
including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy and idiopathic 
hypersomnia. ESS scores were significantly correlated with sleep latency 
measured during the multiple sleep latency test and during overnight 
polysomnography. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ESS scores 
were significantly correlated with the respiratory disturbance index and the 
minimum SaO2 recorded overnight. ESS scores of patients who simply snored did 
not differ from controls.

Marburg, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: Percentiles for the body mass index (BMI) offer a possibility to 
epidemiologically assess the linear weight criterion of 85% average body weight 
commonly used for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.
METHOD: BMI values corresponding to 85% average body weight were calculated and 
assessed with percentiles derived from epidemiological studies in both the 
United States and Germany. The underweight range was characterized 
epidemiologically.
RESULTS: The weight criterion used for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa 
corresponds to BMI values between the 5th and 10th centiles in both populations. 
In epidemiological terms the lowest BMI values in individuals aged 10 years and 
older occur during adolescence. In the general population BMI values <16 kg/m2 
are rarely observed. Upon the use of higher BMI cutoffs in the underweight range 
females clearly predominate. The BMI increase associated with the 5th or 10th 
centile in the age range between 18 and 30 years is quite low suggesting that 
many underweight females in the general population gain only minimal weight 
during this age span.
DISCUSSION: The diagnostic, epidemiological, and therapeutic implications for 
anorexia nervosa are discussed.

Sleep problems are frequently encountered as presenting complaints in child 
neurology clinical practice. They can affect the functioning and quality of life 
of children, particularly those with primary neurological and neurodevelopmental 
disorders, since coexisting sleep problems can add substantially to 
neurocognitive and behavioural comorbidities. Additionally, symptoms of some 
sleep disorders such as parasomnias and narcolepsy can be confused with those of 
other neurological disorders (eg, epilepsy), posing diagnostic challenges for 
paediatric neurologists. The understanding of the neurophysiology of sleep 
disorders such as insomnia, parasomnias, and narcolepsy is still evolving. There 
is a complex relation between the sleeping brain and its waking function. The 
interplay among genetic factors, alterations in neurotransmitters, 
electrophysiological changes, and environmental factors potentially contribute 
to the genesis of these sleep disorders.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are two 
conditions associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). They may coexist 
in the same patient but the frequency of this association and its clinical 
significance is unknown. The presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a 
narcoleptic patient may interfere with the diagnosis of narcolepsy. The aim of 
the study was to determine the prevalence of OSA in narcolepsy.
DESIGN AND SETTING: University hospital sleep clinic series of narcoleptic 
patients diagnosed with nocturnal polysomnography and multiple sleep latency 
test. Patients were systematically interviewed evaluating narcoleptic and OSAS 
features and their response to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 
treatment when applied.
PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty-three patients with narcolepsy.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (24.8%) had an apnea-hypopnea index greater than 
10 with a mean index of 28.5+/-15.7. Ten of them were initially diagnosed only 
with OSAS and the diagnosis of narcolepsy was delayed 6.1+/-7.8years until being 
evaluated in our center for residual EDS after CPAP therapy. In the remaining 23 
patients, narcolepsy and OSA were diagnosed simultaneously. Cataplexy occurred 
with similar frequency in both groups. EDS did not improve in 11 of the 14 
patients who were treated with CPAP. The presence of OSA was associated with 
male gender, older age and higher body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: OSA occurs frequently in narcolepsy and may delay the diagnosis of 
narcolepsy by several years and interfere with its proper management. In 
patients with OSA, cataplexy should be actively looked for to exclude the 
presence of narcolepsy. Treatment with CPAP does not usually improve EDS in 
narcoleptics with OSA.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder whose clinical features 
include excessive daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, cataplexy, 
sleep paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. It has been shown that there may 
be quite a long interval between the onset of symptoms, and the correct 
diagnosis. We tested the hypothesis that given their severe symptomatology, 
these patients would have been diagnosed more often with a variety of 
psychiatric and neurologic conditions than controls in the year prior to 
confirmation of their narcolepsy diagnosis.
DESIGN: Using the Province of Manitoba Health database, we compared the 
diagnoses made in the year prior to initial sleep disorder center evaluation of 
77 patients with narcolepsy (33 males, 44 females) and 1,155 matched control 
subjects from the general population.
SETTING: Sleep disorders center in University-based teaching hospital
PARTICIPANTS: N/A.
INTERVENTIONS: N/A.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients were much more likely than controls to be 
diagnosed with mental disorders (Odds ratio (OR) = 4.0645; 95% confidence limit 
(CL) = 2.4671-6.6962; p<0.0001) and nervous system disorders (OR= 5.0495; CL = 
3.0606 -8.3309; p<0.0001) and there was a trend towards more injuries in these 
patients (OR =1.6316; CL = 0.9857-2.7007; p=0.0514). We found that cases were 
statistically much more likely than controls to have received a diagnosis for 
neurotic disorders (17% of cases), depression (16%), personality disorders (3%) 
and adjustment reaction (4%). Although the cases had twice as many doctor visits 
as the controls (9.3 +/- 0.97 (sem) vs. 4.8 +/- 0.17 p<0.0001), only 38% of them 
had received a diagnosis of narcolepsy in the year prior to sleep specialist 
evaluation. Neurologists had the highest ""success rate"" for correct diagnosis: 
neurologists diagnosed narcolepsy in 55% of the cases they had seen. The other 
medical practitioners diagnosed narcolepsy in a much smaller percentage of the 
cases they had seen: 23.5% for internists (excluding neurologists), 21.9% for 
general practitioners, 11.1% for psychiatrists, and 0% for pediatricians.
CONCLUSIONS: In the year prior to documentation of narcolepsy in a sleep 
disorders center, patients with narcolepsy were diagnosed with a wide variety of 
mental and neurologic disorders. Our findings are supportive of either the 
coexistence of these disorders in narcolepsy patients or a high frequency of 
missed diagnosis by their clinicians. The latter may help explain the very long 
interval between onset of symptoms and correct diagnosis.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify the factual morbidity and mortality of narcolepsy 
in a controlled design.
SETTING: National Patient Registry.
PATIENTS: All national diagnosed patients (757) with health information at least 
3 years prior to and after diagnose of narcolepsy.
CONTROLS: Randomly selected four citizens (3,013) matched for age, sex, and 
socioeconomic status from the Danish Civil Registration System Statistics.
RESULTS: Increased morbidity prior to narcolepsy diagnosis included (odds ratio, 
95% confidence interval):- diseases of the endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic 
systems (2.10, 1.32-3.33); nervous system (5.27, 3.65-7.60); musculoskeletal 
system (1.59, 1.23-2.05); and other abnormal symptoms and laboratory findings 
(1.66, 1.25-2.22). After the diagnosis, narcolepsy patients experienced diseases 
of the endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic (2.31, 1.51-3.54), nervous (9.19, 
6.80-12.41), musculoskeletal (1.70, 1.28-2.26), eye (1.67, 1.03-2.71), and 
respiratory systems (1.84, 1.21-2.81). Specific diagnoses were diabetes (2.4, 
1,2-4.7, P < 0.01), obesity (13.4, 3.1-57.6, P < 0.001), sleep apnea (19.2, 
7.7-48.3, P < 0.001), other sleep disorders (78.5, 11.8-523.3, P < 0.001), 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.8, 1.4-5.8, P < 0.01), lower back pain 
(2.5, 1.4-4.2, P < 0.001), arthrosis/arthritis (2.5, 1.3-4.8, P < 0.01), 
observation of neurological diseases (3.5, 1.9-6.5, P < 0.001), observation of 
other diseases (1.7, 1.2-2.5, P < 0.01), and rehabilitation (5.0, 1.5-16.5, P < 
0.005). There was a trend towards greater mortality in narcolepsy (P = 0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with narcolepsy present higher morbidity several years 
prior to diagnose and even higher thereafter. The mortality rate due to 
narcolepsy was slightly but not significantly higher.

We explored the role of hypocretins in human narcolepsy through histopathology 
of six narcolepsy brains and mutation screening of Hcrt, Hcrtr1 and Hcrtr2 in 74 
patients of various human leukocyte antigen and family history status. One Hcrt 
mutation, impairing peptide trafficking and processing, was found in a single 
case with early onset narcolepsy. In situ hybridization of the perifornical area 
and peptide radioimmunoassays indicated global loss of hypocretins, without 
gliosis or signs of inflammation in all human cases examined. Although 
hypocretin loci do not contribute significantly to genetic predisposition, most 
cases of human narcolepsy are associated with a deficient hypocretin system.

Genetic association, seasonal infections and autoimmune basis of narcolepsy.

In recent years, a growing number of potential autoimmune disorders affecting 
neurons in the central nervous system have been identified, including 
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a lifelong sleep disorder characterized by excessive 
daytime sleepiness with irresistible sleep attacks, cataplexy (sudden bilateral 
loss of muscle tone), hypnagogic hallucinations, and abnormalities of Rapid Eye 
Movement sleep. Narcolepsy is generally a sporadic disorder and is caused by the 
loss of hypocretin (orexin)-producing neurons in the hypothalamus region of the 
brain. Studies have established that more than 90% of patients have a genetic 
association with HLA DQB1*06:02. Genome-wide association analysis shows a strong 
association between narcolepsy and polymorphisms in the TCRα locus and weaker 
associations within TNFSF4 (also called OX40L), Cathepsin H and the P2RY11-DNMT1 
(purinergic receptor subtype P2Y11 to DNMT1, a DNA methytransferase) loci, 
suggesting an autoimmune basis. Mutations in DNMT1 have also been reported to 
cause narcolepsy in association with a complex neurological syndrome, suggesting 
the importance of DNA methylation in the pathology. More recently, narcolepsy 
was identified in association with seasonal streptococcus, H1N1 infections and 
following AS03-adjuvanted pH1N1 influenza vaccination in Northern Europe. 
Potential immunological pathways responsible for the loss of hypocretin 
producing neurons in these cases may be molecular mimicry or bystander 
activation. Specific autoantibodies or T cells cross-reactive with hypocretin 
neurons have not yet been identified, however, thus narcolepsy does not meet 
Witebsky's criteria for an autoimmune disease. As the brain is not an easily 
accessible organ, mechanisms of disease initiation and progression remain a 
challenge to researchers.

Clinical and practical considerations in the pharmacologic management of

Despite published treatment recommendations and the availability of approved and 
off-label pharmacologic therapies for narcolepsy, the clinical management of 
this incurable, chronic neurologic disorder remains challenging. While treatment 
is generally symptomatically driven, decisions regarding which drug(s) to use 
need to take into account a variety of factors that may affect adherence, 
efficacy, and tolerability. Type 1 narcolepsy (predominantly excessive daytime 
sleepiness with cataplexy) or type 2 narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness 
without cataplexy) may drive treatment decisions, with consideration given 
either to a single drug that targets multiple symptoms or to multiple drugs that 
each treat a specific symptom. Other drug-related characteristics that affect 
drug choice are dosing regimens, tolerability, and potential drug-drug 
interactions. Additionally, the patient should be an active participant in 
treatment decisions, and the main symptomatic complaints, treatment goals, 
psychosocial setting, and use of lifestyle substances (ie, alcohol, nicotine, 
caffeine, and cannabis) need to be discussed with respect to treatment 
decisions. Although there is a lack of narcolepsy-specific instruments for 
monitoring therapeutic effects, clinically relevant subjective and objective 
measures of daytime sleepiness (eg, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Maintenance of 
Wakefulness Test) can be used to provide guidance on whether treatment goals are 
being met. These considerations are discussed with the objective of providing 
clinically relevant recommendations for making treatment decisions that can 
enhance the effective management of patients with narcolepsy.

Our goal was to validate a self-administered narcolepsy questionnaire focusing 
on cataplexy. Nine hundred and eight three consecutive subjects entering the 
Stanford Sleep Disorder Clinic completed the questionnaire. Clinic physicians 
reported on the presence or absence of ""clear-cut"" cataplexy. Responses to 51 
cataplexy-related questionnaire items were compared between subjects with 
clear-cut cataplexy (n = 63) and all other patients (n = 920). As previously 
reported, a large portion of the non-narcoleptic population was found to 
experience muscle weakness with various intense emotions (1.8% to 18.0%) or 
athletic activities (26.2% to 28.8%). Factor analysis and Receiver Operating 
Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis were used to determine the most predictive 
items for clear-cut cataplexy. Most strikingly, cataplexy was best 
differentiated from other types of muscle weakness when triggered by only three 
typical situations: ""when hearing and telling a joke,"" ""while laughing,"" or 
""when angry."" Face or neck, rather than limbs, were also more specifically 
involved in clear-cut cataplexy. Other items, such as length of attacks, 
bilaterality, and alteration in consciousness, were poorly predictive. A simple 
decision tree was constructed to isolate high-(91.7%) and low-(0.6%) risk groups 
for cataplexy. This questionnaire will be used to increase diagnostic 
consistency across clinical centers, thus providing more homogenous subject 
pools for clinical and basic research studies.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common 
problem in children, with estimates of 15%; few studies have investigated the 
sequelae of EDS in young children. We investigated the association of EDS with 
objective neurocognitive measures and parent reported learning, 
attention/hyperactivity, and conduct problems in a large general population 
sample of children.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Population based.
PARTICIPANTS: 508 children from The Penn State Child Cohort.
INTERVENTIONS: N/A.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Children underwent a 9-h polysomnogram, comprehensive 
neurocognitive testing, and parent rating scales. Children were divided into 2 
groups: those with and without parent-reported EDS. Structural equation modeling 
was used to examine whether processing speed and working memory performance 
would mediate the relationship between EDS and learning, 
attention/hyperactivity, and conduct problems. Logistic regression models 
suggest that parent-reported learning, attention/hyperactivity, and conduct 
problems, as well as objective measurement of processing speed and working 
memory are significant sequelae of EDS, even when controlling for AHI and 
objective markers of sleep. Path analysis demonstrates that processing speed and 
working memory performance are strong mediators of the association of EDS with 
learning and attention/hyperactivity problems, while to a slightly lesser degree 
are mediators from EDS to conduct problems.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in a large general population sample of 
young children, parent-reported EDS is associated with neurobehavioral 
(learning, attention/hyperactivity, conduct) problems and poorer performance in 
processing speed and working memory. Impairment due to EDS in daytime cognitive 
and behavioral functioning can have a significant impact on children's 
development.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the fact that narcolepsy is a chronic disorder affecting 
younger people, there is insufficient information about its societal burden, 
time course, and familiar effect. We aimed to estimate the factual direct and 
indirect costs of narcolepsy patients and their families in a national sample 
using a controlled study design.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Using records from the Danish National Patient Registry 
(1997-2009), all 816 narcolepsy patients and their partners were identified and 
compared with 3254 randomly chosen controls matched for age, gender, geographic 
area, and civil status. Direct and indirect costs, including frequencies of 
primary and secondary sector contacts' and procedures, medication, labor supply, 
and social transfer payments were extracted from the national databases.
RESULTS: Fewer patients (46.7%) than controls (51.4%) were married or 
cohabiting. Patients with narcolepsy had significantly higher rates of 
health-related contact, medication use, and a higher socioeconomic cost. 
Furthermore, they had lower employment rates, and those in employment had a 
lower income level than control subjects. Partners presented higher public 
health insurance and public transfers and lower income from employment. In all, 
the annual mean excess health-related cost, including social transfers, was 
€9572 for patients with narcolepsy and €3606 for their partners (both p<0.001). 
Patient consequences could be identified up to 11 years before first diagnosis 
and became more pronounced as the disease advanced.
CONCLUSION: Narcolepsy causes socioeconomic consequences, not only for patients, 
but also for their partners, which is present years prior to disease diagnosis, 
confirming a diagnostic delay.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of age on the 
manifestation of narcolepsy symptoms and cognitive difficulties in patients with 
narcolepsy.
METHODS: A total of 321 participants were included in the study: 157 were 
patients with narcolepsy from two Sleep Disorders Clinics and 164 were control 
participants. Narcoleptic patients were evaluated and diagnosed at the Sleep 
Disorders Clinic. All participants were interviewed by telephone using the 
Sleep-EVAL System. The interview comprised, among else, a detailed evaluation of 
narcolepsy symptoms and of cognitive difficulties.
RESULTS: The first manifestation of the disease appeared early in life for most 
narcoleptic patients: 54.1% had their first symptom before the age of 20 years. 
Daytime sleepiness was the first symptom to appear in 65.5% of cases. In 
narcoleptics 60 years or older, cataplexy was more likely to be the first 
symptom to appear (47.4%) compared with other narcoleptic patients (21.4%; 
P<.05). Reported cognitive difficulties (attention-concentration, praxis, delay 
recall, orientation for persons, temporal orientation, and prospective memory) 
were higher in narcoleptic patients compared with the controls. The severity of 
daytime sleepiness and the presence of a major depressive disorder partly 
explained the cognitive difficulties. However, attention-concentration deficits 
and difficulties in prospective memory remained significant. Age was unrelated 
to cognitive difficulties in narcoleptics patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The first manifestation of narcolepsy appears early in life. 
Reported cognitive difficulties are important in narcoleptic patients and are 
only partly explained by age, severity of daytime sleepiness, and major 
depressive disorder.

Narcolepsy-cataplexy is a disabling sleep disorder characterized by excessive 
daytime sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep. The development of human narcolepsy 
involves environmental factors acting on a specific genetic background. The 
importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the reported 25 to 31% of 
monozygotic twins who are concordant for narcolepsy. One of the predisposing 
genetic factors is located in the MHC DQ region. More than 85% of all 
narcoleptic patients with definite cataplexy share a specific HLA allele, HLA 
DQB1*0602 (most often in combination with HLA DR2), compared with 12 to 38% of 
the general population, as evaluated in various ethnic groups. Genetic factors 
other than HLA are also likely to be involved. Even if genuine multiplex 
families are rare, 1 to 2% of the first-degree relatives of narcolepsy patients 
manifest the disorder, compared with 0.02 to 0.18% in the general population. 
Studies using a canine model of narcolepsy illustrate the importance of non-MHC 
genes in disease predisposition. In this model, narcolepsy is transmitted as a 
single autosomal recessive trait, canarc-1. In spite of an association with 
immune-related polymorphisms, narcolepsy does not appear to be a classic 
autoimmune disease. Other pathophysiologic models involving the microglia and 
the release of specific cytokines in the CNS may be involved and are being 
explored. This approach, together with positional cloning studies in humans and 
canines, should reveal the cause of narcolepsy and open new therapeutic avenues.

Murine and canine narcolepsy can be caused by mutations of the hypocretin (Hcrt) 
(orexin) precursor or Hcrt receptor genes. In contrast to these animal models, 
most human narcolepsy is not familial, is discordant in identical twins, and has 
not been linked to mutations of the Hcrt system. Thus, the cause of human 
narcolepsy remains unknown. Here we show that human narcoleptics have an 85%-95% 
reduction in the number of Hcrt neurons. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) 
neurons, which are intermixed with Hcrt cells in the normal brain, are not 
reduced in number, indicating that cell loss is relatively specific for Hcrt 
neurons. The presence of gliosis in the hypocretin cell region is consistent 
with a degenerative process being the cause of the Hcrt cell loss in narcolepsy.

To advance understanding of the clinical spectra of narcolepsy, we 
retrospectively reviewed the histories and clinical and polysomnographic 
features of 41 consecutive patients in whom this diagnosis was established in 
our center over 3 years. A total of 51% presented after the age of 40 years. 
Among the older patients, three subpopulations were noted: 1) 
narcolepsy/cataplexy with presentation delayed because of mild disease severity 
or misdiagnosis; 2) narcolepsy/cataplexy with diagnosis delayed until late-life 
expression of cataplexy; and 3) narcolepsy lacking cataplexy with later-life 
onset of excessive daytime sleepiness. Clinical, polysomnographic, and multiple 
sleep latency test assessments of rapid eye movement sleep dyscontrol and 
sleepiness were unrelated to age. This analysis identified older patients 
lacking cataplexy as the least severely affected narcoleptic subgroup. 
Narcolepsy, a continuum of phenotypes and severities that masks its recognition, 
should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sleepiness or transient 
loss of muscle tone in older patients.

Narcolepsy, a chronic neurologic condition resulting from dysregulation of the 
sleep-wake cycle, usually has an onset at an early age. However, a long delay 
until diagnosis has been consistently reported in the literature across 
countries and several publications have focused on characterizing this delay. 
Most studies report a mean delay to diagnosis of up to 15 years, with individual 
cases of >60 years, although a trend over time toward a shorter diagnostic delay 
has been suggested. While variables associated with this delay have been 
identified, a lack of symptom recognition resulting in misdiagnosis prior to 
reaching the narcolepsy diagnosis is the likely underlying reason. This lack of 
symptom recognition is especially relevant considering the high comorbidity 
burden that has been shown in patients with narcolepsy as some disorders 
manifest with symptoms that overlap with narcolepsy. A consequence of delayed 
diagnosis is delayed treatment, which affects the burden of disease. Substantial 
detrimental effects on health-care resource utilization, employment, and quality 
of life have been described after narcolepsy onset and prior to the diagnosis of 
narcolepsy. This review highlights the importance of closing the diagnostic gap 
by expanding awareness of narcolepsy and its symptoms.

Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep disorder affecting humans and animals. It is 
characterized by daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and striking transitions from 
wakefulness into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In this study, we used 
positional cloning to identify an autosomal recessive mutation responsible for 
this sleep disorder in a well-established canine model. We have determined that 
canine narcolepsy is caused by disruption of the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 
gene (Hcrtr2). This result identifies hypocretins as major sleep-modulating 
neurotransmitters and opens novel potential therapeutic approaches for 
narcoleptic patients.

New developments in the management of narcolepsy.

Narcolepsy is a life-long, underrecognized sleep disorder that affects 
0.02%-0.18% of the US and Western European populations. Genetic predisposition 
is suspected because of narcolepsy's strong association with HLA DQB1*06-02, and 
genome-wide association studies have identified polymorphisms in T-cell receptor 
loci. Narcolepsy pathophysiology is linked to loss of signaling by 
hypocretin-producing neurons; an autoimmune etiology possibly triggered by some 
environmental agent may precipitate hypocretin neuronal loss. Current treatment 
modalities alleviate the main symptoms of excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) and 
cataplexy and, to a lesser extent, reduce nocturnal sleep disruption, hypnagogic 
hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Sodium oxybate (SXB), a sodium salt of γ 
hydroxybutyric acid, is a first-line agent for cataplexy and EDS and may help 
sleep disruption, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Various 
antidepressant medications including norepinephrine serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic 
antidepressants are second-line agents for treating cataplexy. In addition to 
SXB, modafinil and armodafinil are first-line agents to treat EDS. Second-line 
agents for EDS are stimulants such as methylphenidate and extended-release 
amphetamines. Emerging therapies include non-hypocretin-based therapy, 
hypocretin-based treatments, and immunotherapy to prevent hypocretin neuronal 
death. Non-hypocretin-based novel treatments for narcolepsy include pitolisant 
(BF2.649, tiprolisant); JZP-110 (ADX-N05) for EDS in adults; JZP 13-005 for 
children; JZP-386, a deuterated sodium oxybate oral suspension; FT 218 an 
extended-release formulation of SXB; and JNJ-17216498, a new formulation of 
modafinil. Clinical trials are investigating efficacy and safety of SXB, 
modafinil, and armodafinil in children. γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) modulation 
with GABAA receptor agonists clarithromycin and flumazenil may help daytime 
somnolence. Other drugs investigated include GABAB agonists (baclofen), 
melanin-concentrating hormone antagonist, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone 
agonists. Hypocretin-based therapies include hypocretin peptide replacement 
administered either through an intracerebroventricular route or intranasal 
route. Hypocretin neuronal transplant and transforming stem cells into 
hypothalamic neurons are also discussed in this article. Immunotherapy to 
prevent hypocretin neuronal death is reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Drowsiness compromises driving ability by reducing alertness and 
attentiveness, and delayed reaction times. Sleep-related car crashes account for 
a considerable proportion of accident at the wheel. Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), 
narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) are rare central 
disorders of hypersomnolence, the most severe causes of sleepiness thus being 
potential dangerous conditions for both personal and public safety with 
increasing scientific, social, and political attention. Our main objective was 
to assess the frequency of recent car crashes in a large cohort of patients 
affected with well-defined central disorders of hypersomnolence versus subjects 
from the general population.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in French reference centres for 
rare hypersomnia diseases and included 527 patients and 781 healthy subjects. 
All participants included needed to have a driving license, information 
available on potential accident events during the last 5 years, and on potential 
confounders; thus analyses were performed on 282 cases (71 IH, 82 NT2, 129 NT1) 
and 470 healthy subjects.
RESULTS: Patients reported more frequently than healthy subjects the occurrence 
of recent car crashes (in the previous five years), a risk that was confirmed in 
both treated and untreated subjects at study inclusion (Untreated, OR = 2.21 
95%CI = [1.30-3.76], Treated OR = 2.04 95%CI = [1.26-3.30]), as well as in all 
disease categories, and was modulated by subjective sleepiness level (Epworth 
scale and naps). Conversely, the risk of car accidents of patients treated for 
at least 5 years was not different to healthy subjects (OR = 1.23 95%CI = 
[0.56-2.69]). Main risk factors were analogous in patients and healthy subjects.
CONCLUSION: Patients affected with central disorders of hypersomnolence had 
increased risk of recent car crashes compared to subjects from the general 
population, a finding potentially reversed by long-term treatment.

Narcolepsy is a chronic, disabling neurologic disorder characterised by 
excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in up to 60% of patients, cataplexy. 
Treatments for narcolepsy are aimed at improving wakefulness (e.g. modafinil, 
armodafinil, stimulants), reducing cataplexy attacks (e.g. sodium oxybate, 
venlafaxine), and treating the symptoms of disturbed nocturnal sleep, sleep 
paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations (e.g. sodium oxybate). In general, 
medications that increase the release, or inhibit the reuptake, of 
norepinephrine or dopamine have wake-promoting effects and are useful in 
managing EDS, whereas medications that inhibit serotonin or norepinephrine 
reuptake have anticataplectic effects. Modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid B 
(GABAB) receptors or histamine H3 receptors (H3Rs) has effects on both EDS and 
cataplexy. Pitolisant, an H3R antagonist, and solriamfetol, a dopamine and 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, are the most recently approved treatments for 
EDS associated with narcolepsy in the European Union (pitolisant) and the USA 
(pitolisant and solriamfetol). Several new agents are being developed and tested 
as potential treatments for EDS and cataplexy associated with narcolepsy; these 
agents include novel oxybate formulations (once-nightly [FT218]; low sodium 
[JZP-258]), a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (AXS-12), and a 
product combining modafinil and an astroglial connexin inhibitor (THN102). This 
review summarises the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and 
safety/tolerability of recently approved and emerging treatments for narcolepsy.

Since its introduction, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) has played a 
major role in the diagnosis of narcolepsy. We assessed its diagnostic value in a 
series of 2,083 subjects of whom 170 (8.2%) were diagnosed with narcolepsy. The 
sensitivity of the combination of two or more sleep onset rapid eye movement 
(REM) periods (SOREMPs) with a mean sleep latency of < 5 minutes on an initial 
MSLT was 70% with a specificity of 97%, but 30% of all subjects with this 
combination of findings did not have narcolepsy. In some narcoleptics who had 
more than one MSLT, the proportion of naps with SOREMPs varied substantially 
from the initial MSLT to the follow-up test. The highest specificity (99.2%) and 
positive predictive value (PPV) (87%) for MSLT findings was obtained with the 
criteria of three or more SOREMPs combined with a mean sleep latency of < 5 
minutes, but the sensitivity of this combination was only 46%. The combination 
of a SOREMP with a sleep latency < 10 minutes on polysomnography yielded a 
specificity (98.9%) and PPV (73%) almost equal to those obtained from 
combinations of MSLT findings, but the sensitivity was much lower. Our results 
suggest that the MSLT cannot be used in isolation to confirm or exclude 
narcolepsy, is indicated only in selected patients with excessive daytime 
sleepiness, and is most valuable when interpreted in conjunction with clinical 
findings.

Neurons containing the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin) are located exclusively 
in the lateral hypothalamus and send axons to numerous regions throughout the 
central nervous system, including the major nuclei implicated in sleep 
regulation. Here, we report that, by behavioral and electroencephalographic 
criteria, orexin knockout mice exhibit a phenotype strikingly similar to human 
narcolepsy patients, as well as canarc-1 mutant dogs, the only known monogenic 
model of narcolepsy. Moreover, modafinil, an anti-narcoleptic drug with 
ill-defined mechanisms of action, activates orexin-containing neurons. We 
propose that orexin regulates sleep/wakefulness states, and that orexin knockout 
mice are a model of human narcolepsy, a disorder characterized primarily by 
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysregulation.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the potential predictive factors for precocious 
puberty, observed in some cases of childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) and 
for obesity, a much more common feature of NC, through a systematic assessment 
of pubertal staging, body mass index (BMI), and metabolic/endocrine biochemical 
analyses.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional on consecutive recruitment.
SETTING: Hospital sleep center and pediatric unit.
PATIENTS: Forty-three children and adolescents with NC versus 52 age-matched 
obese children as controls.
INTERVENTIONS: N/A.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients underwent clinical interview, 
polysomnographic recordings, cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 measurement, and 
human leukocyte antigen typing. Height, weight, arterial blood pressure, and 
Tanner pubertal stage were evaluated. Plasma lipid and glucose profiles were 
analyzed. When an altered pubertal development was clinically suspected, plasma 
concentrations of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis hormones were determined. 
Children with NC showed a high prevalence of overweight/obesity (74%) and a 
higher occurrence of precocious puberty (17%) than obese controls (1.9%). 
Isolated signs of accelerated pubertal development (thelarche, pubic hair, 
advanced bone age) were also present (41%). Precocious puberty was significantly 
predicted by a younger age at first NC symptom onset but not by 
overweight/obesity or other factors. In addition, overweight/obesity was 
predicted by younger age at diagnosis; additional predictors were found for 
overweight/obesity (short disease duration, younger age at weight gain and lower 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), which did not include precocious puberty. 
NC symptoms, pubertal signs appearance, and body weight gain developed in close 
temporal sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: NC occurring during prepubertal age is frequently accompanied by 
precocious puberty and overweight/obesity, suggesting an extended hypothalamic 
dysfunction. The severity of these comorbidities and the potential related risks 
require a multidiagnostic approach and a tailored therapeutic management.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Narcolepsy is reported to affect 26-56/100,000 in the general 
population. We aimed to describe clinical and polysomnographic features of a 
large narcolepsy cohort in order to comprehensively characterize the narcoleptic 
spectrum.
METHODS: We performed a chart- and polysomnographybased review of all narcolepsy 
patients of the Innsbruck narcolepsy cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 100 consecutive narcolepsy patients (87 with cataplexy [NC], 
13 without cataplexy [N]) were included in the analysis. All subjects had either 
excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy as their initial presenting clinical 
feature. Age at symptom onset was 20 (6-69) years. Diagnostic delay was 6.5 
(0-39) years. The complete narcolepsy tetrad was present in 36/100 patients; 
28/100 patients had three cardinal symptoms; 29/100 had two; and 7/100 had only 
excessive daytime sleepiness. Severity varied broadly with respect to excessive 
daytime sleepiness (median Epworth Sleepiness Scale score: 18, range 10-24), 
cataplexy (8-point Likert scale: median 4.5, range 1-8), hypnagogic 
hallucinations (median 4.5, range 1-7), and sleep paralysis (median 3, range 
1-7). Sleep comorbidity was highly prevalent and ranged from sleeprelated 
movement disorders (n = 55/100), parasomnias (n = 34/100), and sleeprelated 
breathing disorders (n = 24/100), to insomnia (n = 28/100). REM sleep without 
atonia or a periodic limb movement in sleep index > 5/h were present in most 
patients (90/100 and 75/100). A high percentage of narcoleptic patients in the 
present study had high frequency leg movements (35%) and excessive fragmentary 
myoclonus (22%). Of the narcolepsy patients with clinical features of REM sleep 
behavior disorder (RBD), 76.5% had EMG evidence for RBD on the multiple sleep 
latency test (MSLT), based on a standard cutoff of a minimum of 18% of 3-sec 
miniepochs.
CONCLUSION: This study is one of the largest monocentric polysomnographic 
studies to date of patients with narcolepsy and confirms the frequent 
comorbidity of narcolepsy with many other sleep disorders. Our study is the 
first to evaluate the percentage of patients with high frequency leg movements 
and excessive fragmentary myoclonus in narcolepsy and is the first to 
demonstrate EMG evidence of RBD in the MSLT. These findings add to the growing 
body of literature suggesting that motor instability is a key feature of 
narcolepsy.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess comorbidities in a community-based cohort of 
narcolepsy.
METHODS: A 2000-2014 community-based narcolepsy cohort was identified in Olmsted 
County, Minnesota. Records were reviewed by a certified sleep specialist for 
accuracy of diagnosis, and comorbidities were extracted and analyzed. 
Comorbidities in narcolepsy subjects, both at diagnosis and upon follow-up, were 
compared with those in unaffected and age- and sex-matched cohort using 
conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, there was increased association of narcolepsy with 
anxiety (OR 4.56, 95% CI 1.99-10.44), thyroid disease (3.07, 1.19-7.90), 
hypertension (2.69, 1.22-5.93), and hyperlipidemia (2.49, 1.05-5.92). At the end 
of the prolonged observation period of 9.9 years (SD 7.27 years), there was 
increased association of narcolepsy with peripheral neuropathy (11.21, 
1.16-108.11), non-migrainous headache (6.00, 1.73-20.83), glucose intolerance 
(2.39, 1.05-5.45), and automobile-related trauma (2.43, 1.08-5.45). Persistently 
increased both at diagnosis and after a prolonged observation period were 
associations of narcolepsy with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (69.25, 
9.26-517.99 decreasing to 13.55, 5.08-36.14), chronic low back pain (5.46, 
2.46-12.11 to 2.58, 1.39-4.77), depression (4.88, 2.45-9.73 to 3.79, 2.12-6.79), 
psychiatric disorders in general (4.73, 2.49-9.01 to 3.40, 1.94-5.98), 
endocrinopathies (4.15, 1.81-9.56 to 2.45, 1.33-4.49), and obesity (2.27, 
1.13-4.56 to 2.07, 1.15-3.7).
CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based study of narcolepsy comorbidities, both at 
diagnosis and after prolonged follow-up, persistent comorbidities were revealed, 
including OSA, chronic low back pain, psychiatric disorders in general, 
endocrinopathies, and obesity. The comprehensive management of narcolepsy 
requires monitoring for and managing these important associated health 
conditions.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy are common symptoms of 
narcolepsy, a sleep disorder associated with the loss of hypocretin/orexin 
(Hcrt) neurons. Although only a few drugs have received regulatory approval for 
narcolepsy to date, treatment involves diverse medications that affect multiple 
biochemical targets and neural circuits. Clinical trials have demonstrated 
efficacy for the following classes of drugs as narcolepsy treatments: alerting 
medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil/armodafinil, solriamfetol 
[JZP-110]), antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), sodium 
oxybate, and the H3-receptor inverse agonist/antagonist pitolisant. Enhanced 
catecholamine availability and regulation of locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine 
(NE) neuron activity is likely central to the therapeutic activity of most of 
these compounds. LC NE neurons are integral to sleep/wake regulation and muscle 
tone; reduced excitatory input to the LC due to compromise of Hcrt/orexin 
neurons (likely due to autoimmune factors) results in LC NE dysregulation and 
contributes to narcolepsy/cataplexy symptoms. Agents that increase 
catecholamines and/or LC activity may mitigate EDS and cataplexy by elevating NE 
regulation of GABAergic inputs from the amygdala. Consequently, novel 
medications and treatment strategies aimed at preserving and/or modulating 
Hcrt/orexin-LC circuit integrity are warranted in narcolepsy/cataplexy.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common complaint in the general 
population, which may be associated with a wide range of sleep disorders and 
other medical conditions. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized primarily 
by EDS, which involves a substantial burden of illness but is often overlooked 
or misdiagnosed. In addition to identifying low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
hypocretin (orexin) levels, evaluation for narcolepsy requires in-laboratory 
polysomnography (PSG). Polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosis of 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as well as other sleep disorders. However, the use 
of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) to screen for OSA in adults with EDS has 
increased greatly based on its lower cost, lower technical complexity, and 
greater convenience, versus PSG. The most commonly used, types 3 and 4, portable 
monitors for HSAT lack capability for electroencephalogram recording, which is 
necessary for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders and is 
provided by PSG. These limitations, combined with the increased use of HSAT for 
evaluation of EDS, may further exacerbate the under-recognition of narcolepsy 
and other hypersomnias, either as primary or comorbid disorders with OSA. 
Adherence to expert consensus guidelines for use of HSAT is essential. 
Differential clinical characteristics of patients with narcolepsy and OSA may 
help guide correct diagnosis. Continued EDS in patients diagnosed and treated 
for OSA may indicate comorbid narcolepsy or another sleep disorder. Although 
HSAT may diagnose OSA in appropriately selected patients, it cannot rule out or 
diagnose narcolepsy. Therefore, at present, PSG and MSLT remain the cornerstone 
for narcolepsy diagnosis.

Narcolepsy type 1 is a life-long, severe, multifaceted disease often arising in 
childhood or adolescence. Beyond the classical symptoms (excessive daytime 
sleepiness, cataplexy, hallucinations, sleep paralysis and nocturnal fragmented 
sleep), metabolic, endocrinological, psychiatric and psychosocial aspects must 
be considered. Despite the increased awareness after H1N1 pandemic influenza and 
vaccination, narcolepsy is still misdiagnosed and unrecognized. The peculiar 
presentation of symptoms in narcoleptic children could in part explain the 
misdiagnoses. Excessive daytime sleepiness presenting as chronic drowsiness or 
irritability could be stigmatized as laziness or misinterpreted as behavior or 
inattention disorder. The persistent hypotonia and the complex hyperkinetic 
movements that characterize cataplexy close to the onset, could be misdiagnosed 
as a movement disorder or as other neurologic conditions. The consequent 
therapeutic delay could turn into dramatic consequences. The narcolepsy onset, 
indeed, is associated with abrupt weight gain and sometimes with precocious 
puberty that require a prompt recognition and treatment to avoid auxological and 
metabolic complications. Moreover, narcoleptic children could have behavioral 
and psychiatric disorders ranging from mood to psychotic ones that need ad hoc 
management. Accordingly, spreading the awareness outside the sleep specialist 
community is necessary in order to reduce the diagnostic delay and to obtain 
prompt and multidisciplinary management.

BACKGROUND: Narcolepsy is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a typical 
onset in childhood or early adulthood. Narcolepsy may have serious negative 
effects on health-, social-, education-, and work-related issues for people with 
narcolepsy and for their families. The disease may, thus, present a significant 
socioeconomic burden, but no studies to date have addressed the indirect and 
direct costs of narcolepsy.
METHODS: Using records from the Danish National Patient Registry (1998-2005), we 
identified 459 Danish patients with the diagnosis of narcolepsy. Using a ratio 
of 1 patient record to 4 control subjects' records, we then compared the 
information of patients with narcolepsy with that of 1836 records from age- and 
sex-matched, randomly chosen citizens in the Danish Civil Registration System 
Statistics. We calculated the annual direct and indirect health costs, including 
labor supply and social transfer payments (which include income derived from 
state coffers, such as subsistence allowances, pensions, social security, social 
assistance, public personal support for education, etc.). Direct costs included 
frequencies and costs of hospitalizations and weighted outpatient use, according 
to diagnosis-related groups, and specific outpatient costs based on data from 
The Danish Ministry of Health. The use of and costs of drugs were based on data 
from the Danish Medicines Agency. The frequencies and costs from primary sectors 
were based on data from The National Health Security. Indirect costs were based 
on income data derived from data from the Coherent Social Statistics.
RESULTS: Patients with narcolepsy had significantly higher rates of 
health-related contact and medication use and higher expenses, as compared with 
control subjects. They also had higher unemployment rates. The income level of 
patients with narcolepsy who were employed was lower than that of employed 
control subjects. The annual total direct and indirect costs were euro 11,654 
(euro = Eurodollars) for patients with narcolepsy and euro 1430 for control 
subjects (p < 0.001), corresponding to an annual mean excess health-related cost 
of euro 10,223 for each patient with narcolepsy. In addition, the patients with 
narcolepsy received an annual social transfer income of euro 2588.
CONCLUSION: The study confirms that narcolepsy has major socioeconomic 
consequences for the individual patient and for society. Early diagnosis and 
treatment could potentially reduce disease burden, which would have a 
significant socioeconomic impact.

AIMS: To evaluate the impact of obesity on clinical and sleep characteristics in 
a population of narcoleptic children.
METHODS: Data from the children diagnosed with idiopathic narcolepsy in the 
National Reference Centers for Narcolepsy were collected between 2008 and 2011. 
Clinical and electrophysiological characteristics were compared between obese 
(body mass index [BMI] greater than P97) and nonobese children.
RESULTS: The 117 children (65 boys, 59 de novo patients) had a mean age of 11.6 
± 3.1 years on diagnosis. Cataplexy was present in 81%, DQB1*0602 in 91%. Mean 
BMI was 23.2 ± 5.2 kg/m(2) and BMI z-score was 2.9 ± 2.6. Obesity was found in 
60% with a similar prevalence in treated versus de novo patients and in patients 
with and without cataplexy. Sleepiness and cataplexy started earlier in obese 
children. Obese narcoleptic children had lower sleep efficiency, higher apnea 
hypopnea index and respiratory arousals index (RAI) than nonobese children. BMI 
z-score was positively correlated with RAI. Obese children were more tired and 
missed more often school than nonobese children.
CONCLUSION: Obesity affects more than 50% of narcoleptic children, mostly 
younger at disease onset, and has a deleterious impact on sleep quality as well 
as on school attendance.

Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a lifelong disorder of sleep-wake dysregulation 
defined by clinical symptoms, neurophysiological findings, and low hypocretin 
levels. Besides a role in sleep, hypocretins are also involved in regulation of 
heart rate and blood pressure. This literature review examines data on the 
autonomic effects of hypocretin deficiency and evidence about how narcolepsy is 
associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, 
including cardiovascular disease. An important impact in NT1 is lack of 
nocturnal blood pressure dipping, which has been associated with mortality in 
the general population. Hypertension is also prevalent in NT1. Furthermore, 
disrupted nighttime sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness, which are 
characteristic of narcolepsy, may increase cardiovascular risk. Patients with 
narcolepsy also often present with other comorbidities (eg, obesity, diabetes, 
depression, other sleep disorders) that may contribute to increased 
cardiovascular risk. Management of multimorbidity in patients with narcolepsy 
should include regular assessment of cardiovascular health (including ambulatory 
blood pressure monitoring), mitigation of cardiovascular risk factors (eg, 
cessation of smoking and other lifestyle changes, sleep hygiene, and 
pharmacotherapy), and prescription of a regimen of narcolepsy medications that 
balances symptomatic benefits with cardiovascular safety.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate behavioral aspects and quality of life in 
children and adolescents with type 1 narcolepsy (NT1).
METHODS: We performed a case-control study comparing 29 patients with NT1 versus 
sex- and age-matched patients with idiopathic epilepsy (n = 39) and healthy 
controls (n = 39). Behavior and quality of life were evaluated by 
self-administered questionnaires (Child Behavior Checklist, Pediatric Quality of 
Life Inventory). Patient groups were contrasted and scale results were 
correlated with clinical and polysomnographic parameters, and cerebrospinal 
fluid hypocretin-1 levels.
RESULTS: Young patients with NT1 showed increased internalizing problems 
associated with aggressive behavior. Emotional profile in patients with NT1 
positively correlated with age at onset, diagnostic delay, and subjective 
sleepiness, whereas treatment and disease duration were associated with fewer 
behavioral problems (attention problems, aggressive behavior, and attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Psychosocial health domains of pediatric NT1 
were worse than in healthy controls, whereas the physical health domains were 
comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: Young NT1 patients show a discrete pattern of altered behavioral, 
thought, and mood profile in comparison with healthy controls and with 
idiopathic epilepsy patients thus suggesting a direct link with sleepiness. 
Further studies investigating behavior in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia 
or type 2 narcolepsy are needed to disentangle the role of REM sleep dysfunction 
and hypocretin deficiency in psychiatric disorders. Symptoms of withdrawal, 
depression, somatic complaints, thought problems, and aggressiveness were 
common, NT1 children perceived lower school competencies than healthy children, 
and their parents also reported worse psychosocial health. Our data suggest that 
early effective treatment and disease self-awareness should be promoted in NT1 
children for their positive effect on behavior and psychosocial health.

Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a rare central disorder of hypersomnolence 
characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, 
hallucinations, and fragmented nocturnal sleep usually arising in adolescence or 
young adulthood. Recently, the childhood NT1 diagnoses have increased for 
improved disease awareness and for several cases occurring after the H1N1 
pandemic influenza or vaccination. As in adults, the occurrence of NT1 in 
individuals with a genetic predisposition of the immune system (e.g., human 
leukocyte antigen, HLA-DQB1*0602) together with the role of environmental 
triggers (e.g., H1N1 influenza virus, streptococcus β hemolyticus) further 
supports the autoimmune pathogenesis. Children with NT1 close to disease onset 
show a peculiar cataplexy phenotype characterized by persistent hypotonia with 
prominent facial involvement (cataplectic facies) and by a complex mosaic of 
hyperkinetic movement abnormalities that increase during emotional stimulation. 
This phenotype progressively vanishes along the disease course leading to the 
typical picture of cataplexy (i.e., muscle weakness exclusively evoked by strong 
emotions). This possibly explains in part the misdiagnoses and diagnostic delay. 
Childhood NT1 also shows behavioral abnormalities and psychiatric disorders, 
encompassing depressive feelings, hyperactive/aggressive behavior, up to 
psychotic features. The association with obesity and precocious puberty 
strikingly suggests that NT1 arising in prepubertal children may reflect a wide 
hypothalamic derangement secondary to hypocretin neuronal loss. The complexity 
of the childhood NT1 phenotype claims a multidisciplinary assessment and 
management, taking behavioral and endocrinological features into account. NT1 
indeed is a lifelong disorder with a devastating impact on quality of life, 
especially when arising across developmental age, and targeted school programs, 
medicolegal and psychological supports are essential for patients care. 
Controlled studies are mandatory to assess safety and efficacy of the current 
symptomatic off-label medications on which also relies the treatment for 
children with NT1, and hopefully future pathogenetic evidences will pave the way 
to better disease prevention and therapies to modify the disease course.

Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that afflicts 1 in 2000 individuals and is 
characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy-a sudden loss of 
muscle tone triggered by positive emotions. Features of narcolepsy include 
dysregulation of arousal state boundaries as well as autonomic and metabolic 
disturbances. Disruption of neurotransmission through the hypocretin/orexin 
(Hcrt) system, usually by degeneration of the HCRT-producing neurons in the 
posterior hypothalamus, results in narcolepsy. The cause of Hcrt 
neurodegeneration is unknown but thought to be related to autoimmune processes. 
Current treatments for narcolepsy are symptomatic, including wake-promoting 
therapeutics that increase presynaptic dopamine release and anticataplectic 
agents that activate monoaminergic neurotransmission. Sodium oxybate is the only 
medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that alleviates both 
sleep/wake disturbances and cataplexy. Development of therapeutics for 
narcolepsy has been challenged by historical misunderstanding of the disease, 
its many disparate symptoms and, until recently, its unknown etiology. Animal 
models have been essential to elucidating the neuropathology underlying 
narcolepsy. These models have also aided understanding the neurobiology of the 
Hcrt system, mechanisms of cataplexy, and the pharmacology of narcolepsy 
medications. Transgenic rodent models will be critical in the development of 
novel therapeutics for the treatment of narcolepsy, particularly efforts 
directed to overcome challenges in the development of hypocretin replacement 
therapy.

This article addresses the clinical presentation, diagnosis, pathophysiology and 
management of narcolepsy type 1 and 2, with a focus on recent findings. A low 
level of hypocretin-1/orexin-A in the cerebrospinal fluid is sufficient to 
diagnose narcolepsy type 1, being a highly specific and sensitive biomarker, and 
the irreversible loss of hypocretin neurons is responsible for the main symptoms 
of the disease: sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations and 
paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. The process responsible for the 
destruction of hypocretin neurons is highly suspected to be autoimmune, or 
dysimmune. Over the last two decades, remarkable progress has been made for the 
understanding of these mechanisms that were made possible with the development 
of new techniques. Conversely, narcolepsy type 2 is a less well-defined 
disorder, with a variable phenotype and evolution, and few reliable biomarkers 
discovered so far. There is a dearth of knowledge about this disorder, and its 
aetiology remains unclear and needs to be further explored. Treatment of 
narcolepsy is still nowadays only symptomatic, targeting sleepiness, cataplexy 
and disrupted nocturnal sleep. However, new psychostimulants have been recently 
developed, and the upcoming arrival of non-peptide hypocretin receptor-2 
agonists should be a revolution in the management of this rare sleep disease, 
and maybe also for disorders beyond narcolepsy.

Treatment paradigms for cataplexy in narcolepsy: past, present, and future.

Cataplexy is defined as episodes of sudden loss of voluntary muscle tone 
triggered by emotions generally lasting <2 minutes. Cataplexy is most commonly 
associated with and considered pathognomonic for narcolepsy, a sleep disorder 
affecting ~0.05% of the general population. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of 
cataplexy has advanced through study of canine, murine, and human models. It is 
now generally considered that loss of signaling by hypothalamic 
hypocretin/orexin-producing neurons plays a key role in the development of 
cataplexy. Although the cause of hypocretin/orexin neuron loss in narcolepsy 
with cataplexy is unknown, an autoimmune etiology is widely hypothesized. 
Despite these advances, a literature review shows that treatment of cataplexy 
remains limited. Multiple classes of antidepressants have been commonly used 
off-label for cataplexy in narcolepsy and are suggested for this use in expert 
consensus guidelines based on traditional practice, case reports, and small 
trials. However, systematic research evidence supporting antidepressants for 
cataplexy is lacking. The single pharmacotherapy indicated for cataplexy and the 
guideline-recommended first-line treatment in Europe and the US is sodium 
oxybate, the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Clinical trial evidence of 
its efficacy and safety in cataplexy is robust, and it is hypothesized that its 
therapeutic effects may occur through gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type 
B-mediated effects at noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and thalamocortical neurons. 
Additional possible mechanisms for cataplexy therapy suggested by preliminary 
research include antagonism of the histamine H3 autoreceptor with pitolisant and 
intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for amelioration of the presumed 
autoimmune-mediated hypocretin/orexin cell loss. Further research and 
development of therapeutic approaches to cataplexy are needed.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to summarize current knowledge about 
disrupted nighttime sleep (DNS) and sleep instability in narcolepsy, including 
self-reported and objective assessments, potential causes of sleep instability, 
health consequences and functional burden, and management.
METHODS: One hundred two peer-reviewed publications from a PubMed search were 
included.
RESULTS: DNS is a key symptom of narcolepsy but has received less attention than 
excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. There has been a lack of clarity 
regarding the definition of DNS, as many sleep-related symptoms and conditions 
disrupt sleep quality in narcolepsy (eg, hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid 
eye movement sleep behavior disorder, nightmares, restless legs 
syndrome/periodic leg movements, nocturnal eating, sleep apnea, depression, 
anxiety). In addition, the intrinsic sleep instability of narcolepsy results in 
frequent spontaneous wakings and sleep stage transitions, contributing to DNS. 
Sleep instability likely emerges in the setting of orexin 
insufficiency/deficiency, but its exact pathophysiology remains unknown. DNS 
impairs quality of life among people with narcolepsy, and more research is 
needed to determine its contributions to cardiovascular risk. Multimodal 
treatment is appropriate for DNS management, including behavioral therapies, 
counseling on sleep hygiene, and/or medication. There is strong evidence showing

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare the amounts of REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) 
between patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), ""isolated loss of REM 
atonia,"" narcolepsy, and control subjects and determine if there were threshold 
values for the amount of RSWA that differentiate each group from controls.
METHODS: Retrospective analyses of polysomnography (PSG) records were used 
employing strict quantitative criteria for the measurement of phasic and tonic 
EMG activity during REM sleep. The PSG recordings of 47 individuals were 
analyzed (RBD 16, isolated loss of REM atonia 11, narcolepsy 10, control 10).
RESULTS: Patients with the diagnosis of isolated loss of REM atonia had 
significantly lower levels of EMG activity during REM sleep than those with RBD 
but higher than control subjects. RSWA was higher in narcolepsy than in loss of 
REM atonia but lower than for RBD patients. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves provided threshold values with high specificity and sensitivity in 
all patient groups with a cutoff value ≥ 1.22% (100% correctly classified) for 
phasic and ≥ 3.17% for tonic (92% correctly classified) EMG activity in RBD.
CONCLUSION: Quantification of REM sleep EMG activity can successfully 
differentiate RBD and isolated loss of REM atonia patients from controls. The 
consistently increased amount of RSWA in patients with narcolepsy indicates that 
this can be an additional marker for a diagnosis of narcolepsy. Longitudinal 
studies of patients with isolated loss of REM atonia are needed to evaluate if 
these patients are at risk of developing RBD or neurodegenerative disorders.

This review describes the diagnosis and management of cataplexy: attacks of 
bilateral loss of muscle tone, triggered by emotions and with preserved 
consciousness. Although cataplexy is rare, its recognition is important as in 
most cases, it leads to a diagnosis of narcolepsy, a disorder that still takes a 
median of 9 years to be diagnosed. The expression of cataplexy varies widely, 
from partial episodes affecting only the neck muscles to generalized attacks 
leading to falls. Moreover, childhood cataplexy differs from the presentation in 
adults, with a prominent facial involvement, already evident without clear 
emotional triggers ('cataplectic facies') and 'active' motor phenomena 
especially of the tongue and perioral muscles. Next to narcolepsy, cataplexy can 
sometimes be caused by other diseases, such as Niemann-Pick type C, Prader Willi 
Syndrome, or lesions in the hypothalamic or pontomedullary region. Cataplexy 
mimics include syncope, epilepsy, hyperekplexia, drop attacks and 
pseudocataplexy. They can be differentiated from cataplexy using thorough 
history taking, supplemented with (home)video recordings whenever possible. 
Childhood narcolepsy, with its profound facial hypotonia, can be confused with 
neuromuscular disorders, and the active motor phenomenona resemble those found 
in childhood movement disorders such as Sydenham's chorea. Currently, the 
diagnosis of cataplexy is made almost solely on clinical grounds, based on 
history taking and (home) videos. Cataplexy shows remarkable differences in 
childhood compared to adults, with profound facial hypotonia and complex active 
motor phenomena. Over time, these severe symptoms evolve to the milder adult 
phenotype, and this pattern is crucial to recognize when assessing the outcome 
of uncontrolled case series with potential treatments such as immunomodulation. 
Symptomatic treatment is possible with antidepressants and sodium oxybate. 
Importantly, management also needs to involve sleep hygiene advice, safety 
measures whenever applicable and guidance with regard to the social sequelae of 
cataplexy.

Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder of the sleep-wake cycle characterized by 
excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy, nighttime sleep disturbances, and 
REM-sleep-related phenomena (sleep paralysis, hallucinations) that intrude into 
wakefulness. Dysfunction of the hypocretin/orexin system has been implicated as 
the underlying cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy. In most people with 
narcolepsy, symptom onset occurs between the ages of 10 and 35 years, but 
because the disorder is underrecognized and testing is complex, delays in 
diagnosis and treatment are common. Narcolepsy is treated with a combination of 
lifestyle modifications and medications that promote wakefulness and suppress 
cataplexy. Treatments are often effective in improving daytime functioning for 
individuals with narcolepsy, but side effects and/or lack of efficacy can result 
in suboptimal management of symptoms and, in many cases, significant residual 
impairment. Additionally, the psychosocial ramifications of narcolepsy are often 
neglected. Recently two new pharmacologic treatment options, solriamfetol and 
pitolisant, have been approved for adults, and the indication for sodium oxybate 
in narcolepsy has been expanded to include children. In recent years, there has 
been an uptick in patient-centered research, and promising new diagnostic and 
therapeutic options are in development. This paper summarizes current and 
prospective pharmacological therapies for treating both EDS and cataplexy, 
discusses concerns specific to children and reproductive-age women with 
narcolepsy, and reviews the negative impact of health-related stigma and efforts 
to address narcolepsy stigma.

PURPOSE: Narcolepsy type-1 (NT1) is a rare chronic neurological sleep disorder 
with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) as usual first and cataplexy as 
pathognomonic symptom. Shortening the NT1 diagnostic delay is the key to reduce 
disease burden and related low quality of life. Here we investigated the changes 
of diagnostic delay over the diagnostic years (1990-2018) and the factors 
associated with the delay in Europe.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 580 NT1 patients (male: 325, female: 255) from 
12 European countries using the European Narcolepsy Network database. We 
combined machine learning and linear mixed-effect regression to identify factors 
associated with the delay.
RESULTS: The mean age at EDS onset and diagnosis of our patients was 20.9±11.8 
(mean ± standard deviation) and 30.5±14.9 years old, respectively. Their mean 
and median diagnostic delay was 9.7±11.5 and 5.3 (interquartile range: 1.7-13.2 
years) years, respectively. We did not find significant differences in the 
diagnostic delay over years in either the whole dataset or in individual 
countries, although the delay showed significant differences in various 
countries. The number of patients with short (≤2-year) and long (≥13-year) 
diagnostic delay equally increased over decades, suggesting that subgroups of 
NT1 patients with variable disease progression may co-exist. Younger age at 
cataplexy onset, longer interval between EDS and cataplexy onsets, lower 
cataplexy frequency, shorter duration of irresistible daytime sleep, lower 
daytime REM sleep propensity, and being female are associated with longer 
diagnostic delay.
CONCLUSION: Our findings contrast the results of previous studies reporting 
shorter delay over time which is confounded by calendar year, because they 
characterized the changes in diagnostic delay over the symptom onset year. Our 
study indicates that new strategies such as increasing media attention/awareness 
and developing new biomarkers are needed to better detect EDS, cataplexy, and 
changes of nocturnal sleep in narcolepsy, in order to shorten the diagnostic 
interval.

The treatment options currently available for narcolepsy are often 
unsatisfactory due to suboptimal efficacy, troublesome side effects, development 
of drug tolerance, and inconvenience. Our understanding of the neurobiology of 
narcolepsy has greatly improved over the last decade. This knowledge has not yet 
translated into additional therapeutic options for patients, but progress is 
being made. Some compounds, such as histaminergic H3 receptor antagonists, may 
prove useful in symptom control of narcolepsy. The prospect of finding a cure 
still seems distant, but hypocretin replacement therapy offers some promise. In 
this narrative review, we describe these developments and others which may yield 
more effective narcolepsy treatments in the future.

Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and type 2 (NT2), also known as narcolepsy with and 
without cataplexy, are sleep disorders that benefited from major scientific 
advances over the last two decades. NT1 is caused by the loss of hypothalamic 
neurons producing orexin/hypocretin, a neurotransmitter regulating sleep and 
wake, which can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A low CSF level of 
hypocretin-1/orexin-A is a highly specific and sensitive biomarker, sufficient 
to diagnose NT1. Orexin-deficiency is responsible for the main NT1 symptoms: 
sleepiness, cataplexy, disrupted nocturnal sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, 
and sleep paralysis. In the absence of a lumbar puncture, the diagnosis is based 
on neurophysiological tests (nocturnal and diurnal) and the presence of the 
pathognomonic symptom cataplexy. In the revised version of the International 
Classification of sleep Disorders, 3rd edition (ICSD-3-TR), a sleep onset rapid 
eye movement sleep (REM) period (SOREMP) (i.e. rapid occurrence of REM sleep) 
during the previous polysomnography may replace the diurnal multiple sleep 
latency test, when clear-cut cataplexy is present. A nocturnal SOREMP is very 
specific but not sensitive enough, and the diagnosis of cataplexy is usually 
based on clinical interview. It is thus of crucial importance to define typical 
versus atypical cataplectic attacks, and a list of clinical features and related 
degrees of certainty is proposed in this paper (expert opinion). The time frame 
of at least three months of evolution of sleepiness to diagnose NT1 was removed 
in the ICSD-3-TR, when clear-cut cataplexy or orexin-deficiency are established. 
However, it was kept for NT2 diagnosis, a less well-characterized disorder with 
unknown clinical course and absence of biolo biomarkers; sleep deprivation, 
shift working and substances intake being major differential diagnoses. 
Treatment of narcolepsy is nowadays only symptomatic, but the upcoming arrival 
of non-peptide orexin receptor-2 agonists should be a revolution in the 
management of these rare sleep diseases.

Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder frequently occurring from childhood and 
persisting through adolescence and adulthood. Individuals suffering from 
narcolepsy exhibit excessive daytime somnolence, sleep attacks, cataplexy, 
dysomnia, metabolic perturbations including weight gain, and problems in social 
interaction and academic performance. The prevalence of narcolepsy in childhood 
is not known but can be estimated from adult studies to be greater than 20-60 
per 100,000 in Western countries. The 2009 (A) H1N1 vaccination campaign led to 
an increase of narcoleptic cases both in children and in adults, supporting the 
autoimmune hypothesis of the disease. This article focuses on the epidemiology, 
etiology, and particularities of treatment in pediatric narcolepsy and details 
the effects of the drugs used to treat this condition, including recent trends 
in the field. Future therapeutic directions are also discussed. At present, 
medications used to treat children or adolescents have shown efficacy mostly 
based on clinical experience, given the lack of level 1 evidence-based studies 
in the pediatric population. Therefore, most compounds used in adult narcolepsy 
to target clinical symptoms such as wake-promoting or anticataplectic agents are 
prescribed off-label in pediatric patients. Published research shows the benefit 
of drug therapy for narcoleptic children, but these must be dispensed with 
caution in the absence of well conducted clinical trials.

Narcolepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by symptoms of excessive daytime 
sleepiness, irresistible sleep attacks that may be accompanied by cataplexy 
brought on by emotions, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. This is 
a review of 32 empirical articles on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
published in peer-reviewed journals over the past 37 years. Deleterious 
implications on education, recreation, driving, sexual life, and personality are 
associated with the disease with a consequent negative psychosocial impact. 
Sleepiness has an important influence on HRQoL, more than the other symptoms of 
this disorder that have disrupting roles, too. Therefore, patients with 
narcolepsy need assistance not only for medication prescription but also in 
terms of psychological and social support. It is also of importance to assess 
patients with narcolepsy carefully in terms of depressive symptoms because they 
may have a major impact on HRQoL with important clinical implications.

Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a rare sleep disorder caused by the very specific 
loss of hypothalamic hypocretin (Hcrt)/orexin neurons. The exact underlying 
process leading to this destruction is yet unknown, but indirect evidence 
strongly supports an autoimmune origin. The association with immune-related 
genetic factors, in particular the strongest association ever reported in a 
disease with an allele of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene, and with 
environmental factors (i.e., the H1N1 influenza infection and vaccination during 
the pandemic in 2009) are in favor of such a hypothesis. The loss of Hcrt 
neurons is irreversible, and NT1 is currently an incurable and disabling 
condition. Patients are managed with symptomatic medication, targeting the main 
symptoms (excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, disturbed nocturnal sleep), 
and they require a lifelong treatment. Improved diagnostic tools, together with 
an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of NT1, may lead to new 
therapeutic and even preventive interventions. One future treatment could 
include Hcrt replacement, but this neuropeptide does not cross the blood-brain 
barrier. However, Hcrt receptor agonists may be promising candidates to treat 
NT1. Another option is immune-based therapies, administered at disease onset, 
with already some initiatives to slow down or stop the dysimmune process. 
Whether immune-based therapy could be beneficial in NT1 remains, however, to be 
proven.

The ontogenetic sleep hypothesis suggested that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 
is ontogenetically primitive. Namely, REM sleep plays an imperative role in the 
maturation of the central nervous system. In coincidence with a rapidly 
developing brain during the early period of life, a remarkably large amount of 
REM sleep has been identified in numerous behavioral and polysomnographic 
studies across species. The abundant REM sleep appears to serve to optimize a 
cerebral state suitable for homeostasis and inherent neuronal activities 
favorable to brain maturation, ranging from neuronal differentiation, migration, 
and myelination to synaptic formation and elimination. Progressively more 
studies in Mammalia have provided the underlying mechanisms involved in some REM 
sleep-related disorders (e.g., narcolepsy, autism, attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)). We summarize the remarkable alterations of 
polysomnographic, behavioral, and physiological characteristics in humans and 
Mammalia. Through a comprehensive review, we offer a hybrid of animal and human 
findings, demonstrating that early-life REM sleep disturbances constitute a 
common feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders. Our review may assist and 
promote investigations of the underlying mechanisms, functions, and 
neurodevelopmental diseases involved in REM sleep during early life.

Sleepiness is not uncommon in the pediatric population. Although the etiology 
can be multifactorial, sleepiness due to increased sleep drive, also called 
central hypersomnia, is a common cause. The third edition of the International 
Classification of Sleep Disorders updated the diagnostic criteria for several of 
the central disorders of hypersomnolence, most notably narcolepsy. Although the 
International Classification Of Sleep Disorders-3 is not specific to pediatric 
patients, the peak incidence for many of the included disorders occurs during 
childhood or adolescence. As a result, recognition of these lifelong and 
potentially debilitating disorders is imperative for providers who evaluate 
pediatric patients. This review provides an update on recent advances in the 
field and highlights some of the diagnostic dilemmas, unique clinical features, 
and variable presentations associated with central disorders of hypersomnolence 
within the pediatric population.

Central nervous system hypersomnias (narcolepsy type 1 and type 2, idiopathic 
hypersomnia, and Kleine-Levin syndrome) are orphan sleep disorders in which the 
predominant symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness. The evaluation of 
sleepiness requires rigorous clinical and neurophysiologic approaches that may 
include the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, multiple sleep latency tests, and the 
maintenance of wakefulness test. However, to date, no gold standard measurement 
of excessive sleepiness exists, and there are no quantifiable biologic markers. 
The main pathophysiologic feature of central hypersomnias is thought to reflect 
a deficiency of arousal systems, rather than an overactivity of sleep systems or 
an imbalance between those systems. Impaired neurotransmission of 
hypocretin/orexin (neuropeptides of the lateral hypothalamus) is involved in the 
neurobiology of narcolepsy with cataplexy (NT1). NT1 is a well-characterized 
disorder, due to the destruction of hypocretin/orexin neurons by a probable 
autoimmune process. The biologic hallmarks of the other central hypersomnias 
remain unknown, and neurophysiologic biomarkers are still of major importance 
for the diagnosis and characterization of those disorders.

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder with a strong negative impact on quality 
of life, especially when untreated. Diagnostic delay is a persistent problem, 
with obvious detrimental effects on patients. A diagnosis of narcolepsy may be 
delayed because of its broad symptom presentation which is much more 
encompassing than the classical ""tetrad"" of sleepiness, cataplexy, 
hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Furthermore, symptoms can vary over time. 
Presentation of symptoms can also be markedly different between children and 
adults. Finally, common sleep-related comorbidities increase the risk of 
narcolepsy being masked by overlapping symptoms or treatment. In this review, we 
provide a detailed description of the broad and dynamic symptom spectrum of 
narcolepsy, with specific attention to the different manifestations in both 
adults and children. The overarching goal is to help not only sleep specialists, 
but general practitioners, pediatricians, and other caregivers with early 
recognition and prompt diagnosis of this severe but treatable disorder.

INTRODUCTION: Narcolepsy is an under-recognized, rare neurologic disorder of 
hypersomnolence that is associated with increased mortality and medical and 
psychiatric co-morbidities. Narcolepsy exerts a substantial economic burden on 
patients and society. There is currently no cure, and life-long symptomatic 
therapy is needed. Available drugs do not modify the disease course.
AREAS COVERED: This manuscript provides an overview of narcolepsy symptoms, 
diagnosis, pathophysiology, current pharmacotherapies, and emerging treatments. 
Gaps and unresolved issues in diagnosis and management of narcolepsy are 
discussed to answer whether pharmacological options are the way forward.
EXPERT OPINION: Diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy (ICSD-3) need revision and 
greater clarity. Improved recognition of cataplexy and other symptoms through 
educational outreach, new biomarkers, improved test scoring through artificial 
intelligence algorithms, and use of machine learning may facilitate earlier 
diagnosis and treatment. Pharmacological options need improved symptomatic 
therapy in addition to targeted therapies that address the loss of hypocretin 
signaling. Optimal narcolepsy care also needs a better understanding of the 
pathophysiology, recognition of the different phenotypes in narcolepsy, 
identification of at-risk individuals and early recognition of symptoms, better 
diagnostic tools, and a database for research and disease monitoring of 
treatment, side-effects, and comorbidities.

Narcolepsy is mainly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, but the 
characteristic feature is abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena. REM 
sleep disturbances can manifest as cataplexy (in narcolepsy type 1), sleep 
paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, abnormal 
dreams, polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep disruption with sleep-onset REM 
periods, and fragmented REM sleep. Characterization of REM sleep and related 
symptoms facilitates the differentiation of narcolepsy from other central 
hypersomnolence disorders and aids in distinguishing between narcolepsy types 1 
and 2. A circuit comprising regions within the brainstem, forebrain, and 
hypothalamus is involved in generating and regulating REM sleep, which is 
influenced by changes in monoamines, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides. REM sleep 
is associated with brainstem functions, including autonomic control, and REM 
sleep disturbances may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. 
Medications used to treat narcolepsy (and REM-related symptoms of narcolepsy) 
include stimulants/wake-promoting agents, pitolisant, oxybates, and 
antidepressants; hypocretin agonists are a potential new class of therapeutics. 
The role of REM sleep disturbances in narcolepsy remains an area of active 
research in pathophysiology, symptom management, and treatment. This review 
summarizes the current understanding of the role of REM sleep and its 
dysfunction in narcolepsy.

Narcolepsy types 1 and 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia are primary Central Nervous 
System (CNS) disorders of hypersomnolence characterized by profound daytime 
sleepiness and/or excessive sleep need. Onset of symptoms begins typically in 
childhood or adolescence, and children can have unique presentations compared 
with adults. Narcolepsy type 1 is likely caused by immune-mediated loss of 
orexin (hypocretin) neurons in the hypothalamus; however, the causes of 
narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia are unknown. Existing treatments 
improve daytime sleepiness and cataplexy but there is no cure for these 
disorders.

Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a sleep-wake disorder in which people typically 
experience excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and other sleep-wake 
disturbances impairing daily life activities. NT1 symptoms are due to hypocretin 
deficiency. The cause for the observed hypocretin deficiency remains unclear, 
even though the most likely hypothesis is that this is due to an auto-immune 
process. The search for autoantibodies and autoreactive T-cells has not yet 
produced conclusive evidence for or against the auto-immune hypothesis. Other 
mechanisms, such as reduced corticotrophin-releasing hormone production in the 
paraventricular nucleus have recently been suggested. There is no reversive 
treatment, and the therapeutic approach is symptomatic. Early diagnosis and 
appropriate NT1 treatment is essential, especially in children to prevent 
impaired cognitive, emotional and social development. Hypocretin receptor 
agonists have been designed to replace the attenuated hypocretin signalling. 
Pre-clinical and clinical trials have shown encouraging initial results. A 
better understanding of NT1 pathophysiology may contribute to faster diagnosis 
or treatments, which may cure or prevent it.
