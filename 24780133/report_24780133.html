Three of the <br>most commonly used tests: the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), the <br>maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) <br>give results that are significantly correlated in a statistical sense, but are <br>not closely related. The purpose of this investigation was to help clarify this <br>problem. Previously published data from several investigations were used to <br>calculate the reference range of normal values for each test, defined by the <br>mean+/-2 SD or by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. The 'rule of thumb' that many <br>people rely on to interpret MSLT results is shown here to be misleading. <br>Previously published results from each test were also available for narcoleptic <br>patients who were drug-free at the time and who by definition had EDS. This <br>enabled the sensitivity and specificity of the three tests to be compared for <br>the first time, in their ability to distinguish the EDS of narcolepsy from the <br>daytime sleepiness of normal subjects. The receiver operator characteristic <br>curves clearly showed that the ESS is the most discriminating test, the MWT is <br>next best and the MSLT the least discriminating test of daytime sleepiness. The <br>MSLT can no longer be considered the gold standard for such tests.<br><br>DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2869.2000.00177.x<br>PMID: 10733683 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Hypocretin mutations produce narcolepsy in animal models. In <br>humans, narcolepsy is rarely due to hypocretin mutations, but this system is <br>deficient in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain of a small number of <br>patients. A recent study also indicates increased body mass index (BMI) in <br>narcolepsy. The sensitivity of low CSF hypocretin was examined in 38 successive <br>narcolepsy-cataplexy cases [36 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*0602-positive] <br>and 34 matched controls (15 controls and 19 neurological patients). BMI and CSF <br>leptin levels were also measured. Hypocretin-1 was measurable (169 to 376 pg/ml) <br>in all controls. Levels were unaffected by freezing/thawing or prolonged storage <br>and did not display any concentration gradient. Hypocretin-1 was dramatically <br>decreased (&lt;100 pg/ml) in 32 of 38 patients (all HLA-positive). Four patients <br>had normal levels (2 HLA-negative). Two HLA-positive patients had high levels <br>(609 and 637 pg/ml). CSF leptin and adjusted BMI were significantly higher in <br>patients versus controls. We conclude that the hypocretin ligand is deficient in <br>most cases of human narcolepsy, providing possible diagnostic applications. <br>Increased BMI and leptin indicate altered energy homeostasis. Sleep and energy <br>metabolism are likely to be functionally connected through the hypocretin <br>system.<br><br>DOI: 10.1002/ana.1130<br>PMID: 11558795 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Narcolepsy was first shown to be tightly <br>associated with HLA-DR2 (ref. 3) and later sublocalized to DQB1*0602 (ref. 4). <br>Following studies in dogs and mice, a 95% loss of hypocretin-producing cells in <br>postmortem hypothalami from narcoleptic individuals was reported. Using <br>genome-wide association (GWA) in Caucasians with replication in three ethnic <br>groups, we found association between narcolepsy and polymorphisms in the TRA@ <br>(T-cell receptor alpha) locus, with highest significance at rs1154155 (average <br>allelic odds ratio 1.69, genotypic odds ratios 1.94 and 2.55, P &lt; 10(-21), 1,830 <br>cases, 2,164 controls). This is the first documented genetic involvement of the <br>TRA@ locus, encoding the major receptor for HLA-peptide presentation, in any <br>disease. It is still unclear how specific HLA alleles confer susceptibility to <br>over 100 HLA-associated disorders; thus, narcolepsy will provide new insights on <br>how HLA-TCR interactions contribute to organ-specific autoimmune targeting and <br>may serve as a model for over 100 other HLA-associated disorders.<br><br>DOI: 10.1038/ng.372<br>PMCID: PMC2803042<br>PMID: 19412176 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Patients received placebo, modafinil 200 mg, or modafinil 400 mg in <br>divided doses (morning and noon). Evaluations occurred at baseline and at the <br>end of each 2-week period. Compared with placebo, modafinil 200 and 400 mg <br>significantly increased the mean sleep latency on the Maintenance of Wakefulness <br>Test by 40% and 54%, with no significant difference between the two doses. <br>Modafinil, 200 and 400 mg, also reduced the combined number of daytime sleep <br>episodes and periods of severe sleepiness noted in sleep logs. The likelihood of <br>falling asleep as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was equally reduced <br>by both modafinil dose levels. There were no effects on nocturnal sleep <br>initiation, maintenance, or architecture, nor were there any effects on sleep <br>apnea or periodic leg movements. Neither dose interfered with the patients' <br>ability to nap voluntarily during the day nor with their quantity or quality of <br>nocturnal sleep. Modafinil produced no changes in blood pressure or heart rate <br>in either normotensive or hypertensive patients. The only significant adverse <br>effects were seen at the 400-mg dose, which was associated with more nausea and <br>more nervousness than either placebo or the 200-mg dose. As little as a 200-mg <br>daily dose of modafinil is therefore an effective and well-tolerated treatment <br>of excessive daytime somnolence in narcoleptic persons.<br><br>DOI: 10.1212/wnl.49.2.444<br>PMID: 9270575 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The age at onset was bimodal in two independent patient populations: a <br>first peak occurring at 14.7 years, and a second peak occurring at 35. Age at <br>onset clearly differentiates patients with a positive family history of <br>narcolepsy (early onset) from those without a family history. Other clinical and <br>polygraphic findings may indicate that young age at onset is associated with <br>increased severity of the condition (higher frequency of cataplexy and decreased <br>mean sleep latency on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test).<br>CONCLUSION: Bimodal distribution of age at onset of narcolepsy was found in two <br>independent patient populations.

A <br>large sample of narcoleptic patients was also used to further describe <br>symptomatology and natural history for this sleep disorder.<br>DESIGN: Retrospective review of clinical data ascertained from the Stanford <br>Sleep Inventory, polysomnography and MSLT data, as well as clinical notes. <br>Ethnicity was narrowly defined as African (Black) Americans, Caucasians, Asians, <br>and Latinos when both parents and the subject identified with a given ethnic <br>group.<br>SETTING: N/A.<br>PARTICIPANTS: We compared the severity and clinical presentation of narcolepsy <br>in 64 African Americans, 353 Caucasians, 32 Asians, 26 Latinos, and 9 subjects <br>of mixed ethnicity. Subjects were recruited through the Stanford center for <br>narcolepsy research.<br>INTERVENTIONS: N/A.<br>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: A striking similarity in symptomatology, age of onset, <br>and disease severity was found across ethnic groups. Mean age of onset for <br>sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and cataplexy were 19.20, <br>19.50, 20.11 and 23.02 years old. We also found that narcoleptic patients have <br>slightly but significantly elevated body mass index relative to normative data <br>(106.6% of matched controls, p&lt;0.005) and are born slightly more frequently <br>during the month of March. A tight correlation between our previously validated <br>cataplexy scale and DQB1*0602 positivity was observed.

In addition, behavioral measures can be of notable <br>value. Guidelines on the management of narcolepsy have already been published. <br>However contemporary guidelines are necessary given the growing use of modafinil <br>to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in Europe within the last 5-10 years, and <br>the decreasing need for amphetamines and amphetamine-like stimulants; the <br>extensive use of new antidepressants in the treatment of cataplexy, apart from <br>consistent randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials; and the present <br>re-emergence of gamma-hydroxybutyrate under the name sodium oxybate, as a <br>treatment of all major symptoms of narcolepsy. A task force composed of the <br>leading specialists of narcolepsy in Europe has been appointed. This task force <br>conducted an extensive review of pharmacological and behavioral trials available <br>in the literature. All trials were analyzed according to their class evidence. <br>Recommendations concerning the treatment of each single symptom of narcolepsy as <br>well as general recommendations were made. Modafinil is the first-line <br>pharmacological treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and irresistible <br>episodes of sleep in association with behavioral measures. However, based on <br>several large randomized controlled trials showing the activity of sodium <br>oxybate, not only on cataplexy but also on excessive daytime sleepiness and <br>irresistible episodes of sleep, there is a growing practice in the USA to use it <br>for the later indications. Given the availability of modafinil and <br>methylphenidate, and the forseen registration of sodium oxybate for narcolepsy <br>(including excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, disturbed nocturnal sleep) <br>in Europe, the place of other compounds will become fairly limited. Since its <br>recent registration cataplexy sodium oxybate has now become the first-line <br>treatment of cataplexy. Second-line treatments are antidepressants, either <br>tricyclics or newer antidepressants, the later being increasingly used these <br>past years despite few or no randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. As <br>for disturbed nocturnal sleep the best option is still hypnotics until sodium <br>oxybate is registered for narcolepsy. The treatments used for narcolepsy, either <br>pharmacological or behavioral, are diverse. However the quality of the published <br>clinical evidences supporting them varies widely and studies comparing the <br>efficacy of different substances are lacking. Several treatments are used on an <br>empirical basis, specially antidepressants for cataplexy, due to the fact that <br>these medications are already used widely in depressed patients, leaving little <br>motivation from the manufacturers to investigate efficacy in relatively rare <br>indications. Others, in particular the more recently developed substances, such <br>as modafinil or sodium oxybate, are evaluated in large randomized <br>placebo-controlled trials. Our objective was to reinforce the use of those drugs <br>evaluated in randomized placebo-controlled trials and to reach a consensus, as <br>much as possible, on the use of other available medications.<br><br>DOI: 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2006.01473.x<br>PMID: 16987156 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The aim of this study was to describe the <br>health-related quality of life of people with narcolepsy residing in the UK. The <br>study comprised a postal survey of 500 members of the UK narcolepsy patient <br>association, which included amongst other questions the UK Short Form 36 <br>(SF-36), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy <br>Scale (UNS). A total of 305 questionnaires were included in the final analysis. <br>The results showed that the subjects had significantly lower median scores on <br>all eight domains of the SF-36 than normative data, and scored particularly <br>poorly for the domains of role physical, energy/vitality, and social <br>functioning. The BDI indicated that 56.9% of subjects had some degree of <br>depression. In addition, many individuals described limitations on their <br>education, home, work and social life caused by their symptoms. There was little <br>difference between the groups receiving different types of medication. This <br>study is the largest of its type in the UK, although the limitations of using a <br>sample from a patient association have been recognised.

Problems faced by patients with narcolepsy include <br>social stigma associated with this disease, difficulties in obtaining an <br>education and keeping a job, a reduced quality of life and socioeconomic <br>consequences. Two subtypes of narcolepsy have been described (narcolepsy type 1 <br>and narcolepsy type 2), both of which have similar clinical profiles, except for <br>the presence of cataplexy, which occurs only in patients with narcolepsy type 1. <br>The pathogenesis of narcolepsy type 1 is hypothesized to be the autoimmune <br>destruction of the hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus; this <br>hypothesis is supported by immune-related genetic and environmental factors <br>associated with the disease. However, direct evidence in support of the <br>autoimmune hypothesis is currently unavailable. Diagnosis of narcolepsy <br>encompasses clinical, electrophysiological and biological evaluations, but <br>simpler and faster procedures are needed. Several medications are available for <br>the symptomatic treatment of narcolepsy, all of which have quite good efficacy <br>and safety profiles. However, to date, no treatment hinders or slows disease <br>development. Improved diagnostic tools and increased understanding of the <br>pathogenesis of narcolepsy type 1 are needed and might lead to therapeutic or <br>even preventative interventions.<br><br>DOI: 10.1038/nrdp.2016.100<br>PMID: 28179647 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Narcolepsy is currently treated <br>with amphetamine-like central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (for EDS) and <br>antidepressants (for cataplexy). Some other classes of compounds such as <br>modafinil (a non-amphetamine wake-promoting compound for EDS) and <br>gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB, a short-acting sedative for EDS/fragmented nighttime <br>sleep and cataplexy) given at night are also employed. The major pathophysiology <br>of human narcolepsy has been recently elucidated based on the discovery of <br>narcolepsy genes in animals. Using forward (i.e., positional cloning in canine <br>narcolepsy) and reverse (i.e., mouse gene knockout) genetics, the genes involved <br>in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy (hypocretin/orexin ligand and its receptor) in <br>animals have been identified. Hypocretins/orexins are novel hypothalamic <br>neuropeptides also involved in various hypothalamic functions such as energy <br>homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions. Mutations in hypocretin-related genes <br>are rare in humans, but hypocretin-ligand deficiency is found in many <br>narcolepsy-cataplexy cases. In this review, the clinical, pathophysiological and <br>pharmacological aspects of narcolepsy are discussed.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/j.sleep.2007.03.008<br>PMCID: PMC1978248<br>PMID: 17470414 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

None of the <br>children had secondary narcolepsy. Clinical features were similar across puberty <br>groups, except for sleep paralysis, which increased in frequency with age. <br>Common features included excessive weight gain (84% ≥ 4 kg within 6 months of <br>onset of narcolepsy) and earlier puberty (when compared with family members), <br>notably in subjects who gained the most weight. Streptococcus-positive throat <br>infections were reported in 20% of cases within 6 months of onset of narcolepsy. <br>Polysomnographic features were similar across groups, but 3 prepubertal children <br>did not meet Multiple Sleep Latency Test diagnostic criteria. Regarding <br>treatment, the most used and continued medications were modafinil (84% <br>continued), sodium oxybate (79%), and venlafaxine (68%). Drugs such as <br>methylphenidate, tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin reuptake <br>inhibitors were often tried but rarely continued.

In many patients, a <br>short rapid eye movement sleep latency (REML) during the NPSG is also observed <br>but not used diagnostically.<br>OBJECTIVE: To determine diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of nocturnal <br>REML measures in narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency.<br>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study using receiver operating <br>characteristic curves for NPSG REML and MSLT findings (sleep studies performed <br>between May 1976 and September 2011 at university medical centers in the United <br>States, China, Korea, and Europe) to determine optimal diagnostic cutoffs for <br>narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency compared with different samples: controls, <br>patients with other sleep disorders, patients with other hypersomnias, and <br>patients with narcolepsy with normal hypocretin levels. Increasingly stringent <br>comparisons were made. In a first comparison, 516 age- and sex-matched patients <br>with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency were selected from 1749 patients and <br>compared with 516 controls. In a second comparison, 749 successive patients <br>undergoing sleep evaluation for any sleep disorders (low pretest probability for <br>narcolepsy) were compared within groups by final diagnosis of <br>narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. In the third comparison, 254 patients with a <br>high pretest probability of having narcolepsy were compared within group by <br>their final diagnosis. Finally, 118 patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin <br>deficiency were compared with 118 age- and sex-matched patients with a diagnosis <br>of narcolepsy but with normal hypocretin levels.<br>MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of NPSG REML and MSLT as <br>diagnostic tests for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. This diagnosis was <br>defined as narcolepsy associated with cataplexy plus HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity <br>(no cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 results available) or narcolepsy with <br>documented low (≤ 110 pg/mL) cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 level.<br>RESULTS: Short REML (≤15 minutes) during NPSG was highly specific (99.2% [95% <br>CI, 98.5%-100.0%] of 516 and 99.6% [95% CI, 99.1%-100.0%] of 735) but not <br>sensitive (50.6% [95% CI, 46.3%-54.9%] of 516 and 35.7% [95% CI, 10.6%-60.8%] of <br>14) for patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency vs population-based <br>controls or all patients with sleep disorders undergoing a nocturnal sleep study <br>(area under the curve, 0.799 [95% CI, 0.771-0.826] and 0.704 [95% CI, <br>0.524-0.907], respectively). In patients with central hypersomnia and thus a <br>high pretest probability for narcolepsy, short REML remained highly specific <br>(95.4% [95% CI, 90.4%-98.3%] of 132) and similarly sensitive (57.4% [95% CI, <br>48.1%-66.3%] of 122) for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (area under the curve, <br>0.765 [95% CI, 0.707-0.831]). Positive predictive value in this high pretest <br>probability sample was 92.1% (95% CI, 83.6%-97.0%).<br>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients being evaluated for possible <br>narcolepsy, short REML (≤15 minutes) at NPSG had high specificity and positive <br>predictive value and may be considered diagnostic without the use of an MSLT; <br>absence of short REML, however, requires a subsequent MSLT.<br><br>DOI: 10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.1589<br>PMCID: PMC4170796<br>PMID: 23649748 [Indexed for MEDLINE]<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.</p>

A general population comparison sample (N=1464) <br>matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) and interviewed with the same <br>instrument was used to estimate odds ratios (OR).<br>RESULTS: Five diseases were more frequently observed among narcoleptic <br>participants, including hypercholesterolemia (OR, 1.51), diseases of the <br>digestive system (OR, 3.27), heart diseases (OR, 2.07), upper respiratory tract <br>diseases (OR, 2.52), and hypertension (OR, 1.32). Most frequent psychiatric <br>disorders among the narcolepsy group were major depressive disorder (MDD) (OR, <br>2.67) and social anxiety disorder (OR, 2.43), both affecting nearly 20% of <br>narcoleptic individuals.

We <br>have analysed retrospective data of 1099 patients with narcolepsy diagnosed <br>according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2. Demographic and <br>clinical characteristics, polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test data, <br>hypocretin-1 levels, and genome-wide genotypes were available. We found a <br>significantly lower age at sleepiness onset (men versus women: 23.74 ± 12.43 <br>versus 21.49 ± 11.83, P = 0.003) and longer diagnostic delay in women (men <br>versus women: 13.82 ± 13.79 versus 15.62 ± 14.94, P = 0.044). The mean <br>diagnostic delay was 14.63 ± 14.31 years, and longer delay was associated with <br>higher body mass index. The best predictors of short diagnostic delay were young <br>age at diagnosis, cataplexy as the first symptom and higher frequency of <br>cataplexy attacks. The mean multiple sleep latency negatively correlated with <br>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and with the number of sleep-onset rapid eye <br>movement periods (SOREMPs), but none of the polysomnographic variables was <br>associated with subjective or objective measures of sleepiness. Variant <br>rs2859998 in UBXN2B gene showed a strong association (P = 1.28E-07) with the age <br>at onset of excessive daytime sleepiness, and rs12425451 near the transcription <br>factor TEAD4 (P = 1.97E-07) with the age at onset of cataplexy. Altogether, our <br>results indicate that the diagnostic delay remains extremely long, age and <br>gender substantially affect symptoms, and that a genetic predisposition affects <br>the age at onset of symptoms.<br><br>© 2013 European Sleep Research Society.<br><br>DOI: 10.1111/jsr.12044<br>PMID: 23496005 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

There are no multivariate analyses reported in <br>the literature of factors that may contribute to this delay. The aims of this <br>study were to describe the delay in diagnosis of people with narcolepsy living <br>in the UK and to identify associated factors.<br>METHODS: The study comprised a postal survey of 500 members of the Narcolepsy <br>Association UK, which included questions regarding age of onset of symptoms, <br>year of diagnosis and subject demographics. Cox's proportional hazards <br>regression was performed.<br>RESULTS: A total of 313 questionnaires were returned of which 219 had been <br>completed sufficiently for analysis. The interval between symptom onset and <br>diagnosis ranged from within 1 to 61 years with a median of 10.5 years. <br>Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of cataplexy as one of the <br>initial symptoms and a more recent year of symptom onset were the only factors <br>associated with time to diagnosis.<br>CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that the diagnosis of narcolepsy can be delayed <br>for many years particularly when cataplexy is absent initially. The delay in <br>diagnosis in the UK appears to be decreasing, probably through greater doctor <br>and patient awareness of the clinical manifestations of narcolepsy.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/j.sleep.2003.06.002<br>PMID: 14725825 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Blood glucose levels were determined by oximetry before and 30, 60, <br>and 120 min after the glucose administration. Serum insulin concentrations (IRI) <br>were determined by enzyme immunoassay, and an insulinogenic index (II) was <br>calculated. (II = the ratio of IRI increment to blood glucose increment in 30 <br>min following glucose load). From the results of the OGTT, six patients with <br>definite diabetes mellitus (DM) were identified (12.5%, 4 men and 2 women) <br>according to World Health Organization criteria (1980). The II of the DM <br>patients was significantly low, with an average of 0.13 +/- 0.03. From recent <br>data in the literature on the prevalence of DM in the general Japanese adult <br>population (1.75-5.5%), it was concluded that the frequency of DM among our <br>randomly selected narcoleptic patients was significantly increased. The positive <br>results for diabetes in our six narcoleptic patients could not be attributed to <br>obesity, because there was no difference between the obesity indices of DM and <br>nonDM narcoleptic patients, nor was there a difference between the frequency of <br>DM in obese and nonobese patients.<br><br>DOI: 10.1093/sleep/9.1.254<br>PMID: 3518018 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

TRoth1@hfhs.org<br><br>STUDY OBJECTIVES: Characterize disrupted nighttime sleep (DNS) in narcolepsy, an <br>important symptom of narcolepsy.<br>METHODS: A panel of international narcolepsy experts was convened in 2011 to <br>build a consensus characterization of DNS in patients with narcolepsy. A <br>literature search of the Medline (1965 to date), Medline In-Process (latest <br>weeks), Embase (1974 to date), Embase Alert (latest 8 weeks), and Biosis (1965 <br>to date) databases was conducted using the following search terms: narcolepsy <br>and disrupted nighttime sleep, disturbed nighttime sleep, fragmented sleep, <br>consolidated sleep, sleep disruption, and narcolepsy questionnaire. The purpose <br>of the literature search was to identify publications characterizing the <br>nighttime sleep of patients with narcolepsy. The panel reviewed the literature. <br>Nocturnal sleep can also be disturbed by REM sleep abnormalities such as vivid <br>dreaming and REM sleep behavior disorder; however, these were not reviewed in <br>the current paper, as we were evaluating for idiopathic sleep disturbances.<br>RESULTS: The literature reviewed provide a consistent characterization of <br>nighttime sleep in patients with narcolepsy as fragmented, with reports of <br>frequent, brief nightly awakenings with difficulties returning to sleep and <br>associated reports of poor sleep quality. Polysomnographic studies consistently <br>report frequent awakenings/arousals after sleep onset, more stage 1 (S1) sleep, <br>and more frequent shifts to S1 sleep or wake from deeper stages of sleep. The <br>consensus of the International Experts' Panel on Narcolepsy was that DNS can be <br>distressing for patients with narcolepsy and that treatment of DNS warrants <br>consideration.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians involved in the management of patients with narcolepsy <br>should investigate patients' quality of nighttime sleep, give weight and <br>consideration to patient reports of nighttime sleep experience, and consider DNS <br>a target for treatment.<br><br>DOI: 10.5664/jcsm.3004<br>PMCID: PMC3746724<br>PMID: 23997709 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

A standardized telephone interview was used to <br>inquire about the disease and its burdens to the patients. HRQoL was recorded <br>using the 36-item short-form Medical Outcomes Study (SF-36) as well as the <br>Euroqol (EQ-5D). Frequency and factors of influence on decreased HRQoL were <br>evaluated by using bivariate and multivariate analyses.<br>RESULTS: Patients with narcolepsy had considerably lower scores on all eight <br>domains of the SF-36 compared to the general German population. In particular, <br>scores were poor for the dimensions "physical role", "vitality", and "general <br>health perception". Forty-eight percent of the patients reported problems in at <br>least one of the EQ-5D items; most frequent were problems in the dimension <br>"usual activity" (63.8%), "pain/discomfort" (61.7%) and "anxiety/depression" <br>(41.1%). Difficulty maintaining "self-care" was documented only by 6.8%. The <br>mean VAS score was 60.7%. Interestingly, signs and symptoms of narcolepsy, <br>except for irresistible sleep episodes (p&lt;0.03), had only a minor impact on <br>HRQoL. Multivariate analyses confirmed a strong influence of employment status, <br>living with a partner, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and professional <br>advancement.<br>CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL is considerably reduced in patients, with narcolepsy <br>affecting the different dimensions to various degrees. Factors other than <br>clinical signs and symptoms are associated also with poor HRQoL. Measures should <br>be taken to integrate those factors into healthcare guidelines in order to <br>improve the quality of life in patients with narcolepsy.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/j.sleep.2006.10.010<br>PMID: 17512797 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a <br>narcoleptic patient may interfere with the diagnosis of narcolepsy. The aim of <br>the study was to determine the prevalence of OSA in narcolepsy.<br>DESIGN AND SETTING: University hospital sleep clinic series of narcoleptic <br>patients diagnosed with nocturnal polysomnography and multiple sleep latency <br>test. Patients were systematically interviewed evaluating narcoleptic and OSAS <br>features and their response to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) <br>treatment when applied.<br>PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty-three patients with narcolepsy.<br>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (24.8%) had an apnea-hypopnea index greater than <br>10 with a mean index of 28.5+/-15.7. Ten of them were initially diagnosed only <br>with OSAS and the diagnosis of narcolepsy was delayed 6.1+/-7.8years until being <br>evaluated in our center for residual EDS after CPAP therapy. In the remaining 23 <br>patients, narcolepsy and OSA were diagnosed simultaneously. Cataplexy occurred <br>with similar frequency in both groups. EDS did not improve in 11 of the 14 <br>patients who were treated with CPAP. The presence of OSA was associated with <br>male gender, older age and higher body mass index.<br>CONCLUSIONS: OSA occurs frequently in narcolepsy and may delay the diagnosis of <br>narcolepsy by several years and interfere with its proper management. In <br>patients with OSA, cataplexy should be actively looked for to exclude the <br>presence of narcolepsy.

Kryger@sleep.umanitoba.ca<br><br>STUDY OBJECTIVES: Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder whose clinical features <br>include excessive daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, cataplexy, <br>sleep paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. It has been shown that there may <br>be quite a long interval between the onset of symptoms, and the correct <br>diagnosis. We tested the hypothesis that given their severe symptomatology, <br>these patients would have been diagnosed more often with a variety of <br>psychiatric and neurologic conditions than controls in the year prior to <br>confirmation of their narcolepsy diagnosis.<br>DESIGN: Using the Province of Manitoba Health database, we compared the <br>diagnoses made in the year prior to initial sleep disorder center evaluation of <br>77 patients with narcolepsy (33 males, 44 females) and 1,155 matched control <br>subjects from the general population.<br>SETTING: Sleep disorders center in University-based teaching hospital<br>PARTICIPANTS: N/A.<br>INTERVENTIONS: N/A.<br>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients were much more likely than controls to be <br>diagnosed with mental disorders (Odds ratio (OR) = 4.0645; 95% confidence limit <br>(CL) = 2.4671-6.6962; p&lt;0.0001) and nervous system disorders (OR= 5.0495; CL = <br>3.0606 -8.3309; p&lt;0.0001) and there was a trend towards more injuries in these <br>patients (OR =1.6316; CL = 0.9857-2.7007; p=0.0514). We found that cases were <br>statistically much more likely than controls to have received a diagnosis for <br>neurotic disorders (17% of cases), depression (16%), personality disorders (3%) <br>and adjustment reaction (4%). Although the cases had twice as many doctor visits <br>as the controls (9.3 +/- 0.97 (sem) vs. 4.8 +/- 0.17 p&lt;0.0001), only 38% of them <br>had received a diagnosis of narcolepsy in the year prior to sleep specialist <br>evaluation. Neurologists had the highest "success rate" for correct diagnosis: <br>neurologists diagnosed narcolepsy in 55% of the cases they had seen. The other <br>medical practitioners diagnosed narcolepsy in a much smaller percentage of the <br>cases they had seen: 23.5% for internists (excluding neurologists), 21.9% for <br>general practitioners, 11.1% for psychiatrists, and 0% for pediatricians.<br>CONCLUSIONS: In the year prior to documentation of narcolepsy in a sleep <br>disorders center, patients with narcolepsy were diagnosed with a wide variety of <br>mental and neurologic disorders. Our findings are supportive of either the <br>coexistence of these disorders in narcolepsy patients or a high frequency of <br>missed diagnosis by their clinicians. The latter may help explain the very long <br>interval between onset of symptoms and correct diagnosis.<br><br>DOI: 10.1093/sleep/25.1.36<br>PMID: 11833859 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Specific diagnoses were diabetes (2.4, <br>1,2-4.7, P &lt; 0.01), obesity (13.4, 3.1-57.6, P &lt; 0.001), sleep apnea (19.2, <br>7.7-48.3, P &lt; 0.001), other sleep disorders (78.5, 11.8-523.3, P &lt; 0.001), <br>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.8, 1.4-5.8, P &lt; 0.01), lower back pain <br>(2.5, 1.4-4.2, P &lt; 0.001), arthrosis/arthritis (2.5, 1.3-4.8, P &lt; 0.01), <br>observation of neurological diseases (3.5, 1.9-6.5, P &lt; 0.001), observation of <br>other diseases (1.7, 1.2-2.5, P &lt; 0.01), and rehabilitation (5.0, 1.5-16.5, P &lt; <br>0.005). There was a trend towards greater mortality in narcolepsy (P = 0.07).<br>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with narcolepsy present higher morbidity several years <br>prior to diagnose and even higher thereafter. The mortality rate due to <br>narcolepsy was slightly but not significantly higher.<br><br>DOI: 10.5665/sleep.2706<br>PMCID: PMC3649826<br>PMID: 23729926 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Narcolepsy is a lifelong sleep disorder characterized by excessive <br>daytime sleepiness with irresistible sleep attacks, cataplexy (sudden bilateral <br>loss of muscle tone), hypnagogic hallucinations, and abnormalities of Rapid Eye <br>Movement sleep. Narcolepsy is generally a sporadic disorder and is caused by the <br>loss of hypocretin (orexin)-producing neurons in the hypothalamus region of the <br>brain. Studies have established that more than 90% of patients have a genetic <br>association with HLA DQB1*06:02. Genome-wide association analysis shows a strong <br>association between narcolepsy and polymorphisms in the TCRα locus and weaker <br>associations within TNFSF4 (also called OX40L), Cathepsin H and the P2RY11-DNMT1 <br>(purinergic receptor subtype P2Y11 to DNMT1, a DNA methytransferase) loci, <br>suggesting an autoimmune basis. Mutations in DNMT1 have also been reported to <br>cause narcolepsy in association with a complex neurological syndrome, suggesting <br>the importance of DNA methylation in the pathology. More recently, narcolepsy <br>was identified in association with seasonal streptococcus, H1N1 infections and <br>following AS03-adjuvanted pH1N1 influenza vaccination in Northern Europe. <br>Potential immunological pathways responsible for the loss of hypocretin <br>producing neurons in these cases may be molecular mimicry or bystander <br>activation. Specific autoantibodies or T cells cross-reactive with hypocretin <br>neurons have not yet been identified, however, thus narcolepsy does not meet <br>Witebsky's criteria for an autoimmune disease. As the brain is not an easily <br>accessible organ, mechanisms of disease initiation and progression remain a <br>challenge to researchers.<br><br>Copyright © 2013.

While treatment <br>is generally symptomatically driven, decisions regarding which drug(s) to use <br>need to take into account a variety of factors that may affect adherence, <br>efficacy, and tolerability. Type 1 narcolepsy (predominantly excessive daytime <br>sleepiness with cataplexy) or type 2 narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness <br>without cataplexy) may drive treatment decisions, with consideration given <br>either to a single drug that targets multiple symptoms or to multiple drugs that <br>each treat a specific symptom. Other drug-related characteristics that affect <br>drug choice are dosing regimens, tolerability, and potential drug-drug <br>interactions. Additionally, the patient should be an active participant in <br>treatment decisions, and the main symptomatic complaints, treatment goals, <br>psychosocial setting, and use of lifestyle substances (ie, alcohol, nicotine, <br>caffeine, and cannabis) need to be discussed with respect to treatment <br>decisions. Although there is a lack of narcolepsy-specific instruments for <br>monitoring therapeutic effects, clinically relevant subjective and objective <br>measures of daytime sleepiness (eg, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Maintenance of <br>Wakefulness Test) can be used to provide guidance on whether treatment goals are <br>being met. These considerations are discussed with the objective of providing <br>clinically relevant recommendations for making treatment decisions that can <br>enhance the effective management of patients with narcolepsy.<br><br>Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

Nine hundred and eight three consecutive subjects entering the <br>Stanford Sleep Disorder Clinic completed the questionnaire. Clinic physicians <br>reported on the presence or absence of "clear-cut" cataplexy. Responses to 51 <br>cataplexy-related questionnaire items were compared between subjects with <br>clear-cut cataplexy (n = 63) and all other patients (n = 920). As previously <br>reported, a large portion of the non-narcoleptic population was found to <br>experience muscle weakness with various intense emotions (1.8% to 18.0%) or <br>athletic activities (26.2% to 28.8%). Factor analysis and Receiver Operating <br>Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis were used to determine the most predictive <br>items for clear-cut cataplexy. Most strikingly, cataplexy was best <br>differentiated from other types of muscle weakness when triggered by only three <br>typical situations: "when hearing and telling a joke," "while laughing," or <br>"when angry." Face or neck, rather than limbs, were also more specifically <br>involved in clear-cut cataplexy. Other items, such as length of attacks, <br>bilaterality, and alteration in consciousness, were poorly predictive. A simple <br>decision tree was constructed to isolate high-(91.7%) and low-(0.6%) risk groups <br>for cataplexy. This questionnaire will be used to increase diagnostic <br>consistency across clinical centers, thus providing more homogenous subject <br>pools for clinical and basic research studies.<br><br>PMID: 9989368 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

We investigated the association of EDS with <br>objective neurocognitive measures and parent reported learning, <br>attention/hyperactivity, and conduct problems in a large general population <br>sample of children.<br>DESIGN: Cross-sectional.<br>SETTING: Population based.<br>PARTICIPANTS: 508 children from The Penn State Child Cohort.<br>INTERVENTIONS: N/A.<br>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Children underwent a 9-h polysomnogram, comprehensive <br>neurocognitive testing, and parent rating scales. Children were divided into 2 <br>groups: those with and without parent-reported EDS. Structural equation modeling <br>was used to examine whether processing speed and working memory performance <br>would mediate the relationship between EDS and learning, <br>attention/hyperactivity, and conduct problems. Logistic regression models <br>suggest that parent-reported learning, attention/hyperactivity, and conduct <br>problems, as well as objective measurement of processing speed and working <br>memory are significant sequelae of EDS, even when controlling for AHI and <br>objective markers of sleep. Path analysis demonstrates that processing speed and <br>working memory performance are strong mediators of the association of EDS with <br>learning and attention/hyperactivity problems, while to a slightly lesser degree <br>are mediators from EDS to conduct problems.<br>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in a large general population sample of <br>young children, parent-reported EDS is associated with neurobehavioral <br>(learning, attention/hyperactivity, conduct) problems and poorer performance in <br>processing speed and working memory.

Narcoleptic patients were evaluated and diagnosed at the Sleep <br>Disorders Clinic. All participants were interviewed by telephone using the <br>Sleep-EVAL System. The interview comprised, among else, a detailed evaluation of <br>narcolepsy symptoms and of cognitive difficulties.<br>RESULTS: The first manifestation of the disease appeared early in life for most <br>narcoleptic patients: 54.1% had their first symptom before the age of 20 years. <br>Daytime sleepiness was the first symptom to appear in 65.5% of cases. In <br>narcoleptics 60 years or older, cataplexy was more likely to be the first <br>symptom to appear (47.4%) compared with other narcoleptic patients (21.4%; <br>P&lt;.05). Reported cognitive difficulties (attention-concentration, praxis, delay <br>recall, orientation for persons, temporal orientation, and prospective memory) <br>were higher in narcoleptic patients compared with the controls.

The development of human narcolepsy <br>involves environmental factors acting on a specific genetic background. The <br>importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the reported 25 to 31% of <br>monozygotic twins who are concordant for narcolepsy. One of the predisposing <br>genetic factors is located in the MHC DQ region. More than 85% of all <br>narcoleptic patients with definite cataplexy share a specific HLA allele, HLA <br>DQB1*0602 (most often in combination with HLA DR2), compared with 12 to 38% of <br>the general population, as evaluated in various ethnic groups. Genetic factors <br>other than HLA are also likely to be involved. Even if genuine multiplex <br>families are rare, 1 to 2% of the first-degree relatives of narcolepsy patients <br>manifest the disorder, compared with 0.02 to 0.18% in the general population. <br>Studies using a canine model of narcolepsy illustrate the importance of non-MHC <br>genes in disease predisposition. In this model, narcolepsy is transmitted as a <br>single autosomal recessive trait, canarc-1. In spite of an association with <br>immune-related polymorphisms, narcolepsy does not appear to be a classic <br>autoimmune disease. Other pathophysiologic models involving the microglia and <br>the release of specific cytokines in the CNS may be involved and are being <br>explored. This approach, together with positional cloning studies in humans and <br>canines, should reveal the cause of narcolepsy and open new therapeutic avenues.<br><br>DOI: 10.1212/wnl.50.2_suppl_1.s16<br>PMID: 9484418 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

However, a long delay <br>until diagnosis has been consistently reported in the literature across <br>countries and several publications have focused on characterizing this delay. <br>Most studies report a mean delay to diagnosis of up to 15 years, with individual <br>cases of &gt;60 years, although a trend over time toward a shorter diagnostic delay <br>has been suggested. While variables associated with this delay have been <br>identified, a lack of symptom recognition resulting in misdiagnosis prior to <br>reaching the narcolepsy diagnosis is the likely underlying reason. This lack of <br>symptom recognition is especially relevant considering the high comorbidity <br>burden that has been shown in patients with narcolepsy as some disorders <br>manifest with symptoms that overlap with narcolepsy. A consequence of delayed <br>diagnosis is delayed treatment, which affects the burden of disease. Substantial <br>detrimental effects on health-care resource utilization, employment, and quality <br>of life have been described after narcolepsy onset and prior to the diagnosis of <br>narcolepsy.

Nat Sci Sleep. 2017 Mar 3;9:39-57. doi: 10.2147/NSS.S103467. eCollection 2017.<br><br>New developments in the management of narcolepsy.<br><br>Abad VC(1), Guilleminault C(1).<br><br>Author information:<br>(1)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Division of Sleep Medicine, <br>Stanford University Outpatient Center, Redwood City, CA, USA.<br><br>Narcolepsy is a life-long, underrecognized sleep disorder that affects <br>0.02%-0.18% of the US and Western European populations. Genetic predisposition <br>is suspected because of narcolepsy's strong association with HLA DQB1*06-02, and <br>genome-wide association studies have identified polymorphisms in T-cell receptor <br>loci. Narcolepsy pathophysiology is linked to loss of signaling by <br>hypocretin-producing neurons; an autoimmune etiology possibly triggered by some <br>environmental agent may precipitate hypocretin neuronal loss. Current treatment <br>modalities alleviate the main symptoms of excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) and <br>cataplexy and, to a lesser extent, reduce nocturnal sleep disruption, hypnagogic <br>hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Sodium oxybate (SXB), a sodium salt of γ <br>hydroxybutyric acid, is a first-line agent for cataplexy and EDS and may help <br>sleep disruption, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Various <br>antidepressant medications including norepinephrine serotonin reuptake <br>inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic <br>antidepressants are second-line agents for treating cataplexy. In addition to <br>SXB, modafinil and armodafinil are first-line agents to treat EDS. Second-line <br>agents for EDS are stimulants such as methylphenidate and extended-release <br>amphetamines. Emerging therapies include non-hypocretin-based therapy, <br>hypocretin-based treatments, and immunotherapy to prevent hypocretin neuronal <br>death. Non-hypocretin-based novel treatments for narcolepsy include pitolisant <br>(BF2.649, tiprolisant); JZP-110 (ADX-N05) for EDS in adults; JZP 13-005 for <br>children; JZP-386, a deuterated sodium oxybate oral suspension; FT 218 an <br>extended-release formulation of SXB; and JNJ-17216498, a new formulation of <br>modafinil. Clinical trials are investigating efficacy and safety of SXB, <br>modafinil, and armodafinil in children. γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) modulation <br>with GABAA receptor agonists clarithromycin and flumazenil may help daytime <br>somnolence. Other drugs investigated include GABAB agonists (baclofen), <br>melanin-concentrating hormone antagonist, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone <br>agonists. Hypocretin-based therapies include hypocretin peptide replacement <br>administered either through an intracerebroventricular route or intranasal <br>route. Hypocretin neuronal transplant and transforming stem cells into <br>hypothalamic neurons are also discussed in this article. Immunotherapy to <br>prevent hypocretin neuronal death is reviewed.<br><br>DOI: 10.2147/NSS.S103467<br>PMCID: PMC5344488<br>PMID: 28424564<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of <br>interest in this work.</p>

Sleep-related car crashes account for <br>a considerable proportion of accident at the wheel. Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), <br>narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) are rare central <br>disorders of hypersomnolence, the most severe causes of sleepiness thus being <br>potential dangerous conditions for both personal and public safety with <br>increasing scientific, social, and political attention. Our main objective was <br>to assess the frequency of recent car crashes in a large cohort of patients <br>affected with well-defined central disorders of hypersomnolence versus subjects <br>from the general population.<br>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in French reference centres for <br>rare hypersomnia diseases and included 527 patients and 781 healthy subjects. <br>All participants included needed to have a driving license, information <br>available on potential accident events during the last 5 years, and on potential <br>confounders; thus analyses were performed on 282 cases (71 IH, 82 NT2, 129 NT1) <br>and 470 healthy subjects.<br>RESULTS: Patients reported more frequently than healthy subjects the occurrence <br>of recent car crashes (in the previous five years), a risk that was confirmed in <br>both treated and untreated subjects at study inclusion (Untreated, OR = 2.21 <br>95%CI = [1.30-3.76], Treated OR = 2.04 95%CI = [1.26-3.30]), as well as in all <br>disease categories, and was modulated by subjective sleepiness level (Epworth <br>scale and naps). Conversely, the risk of car accidents of patients treated for <br>at least 5 years was not different to healthy subjects (OR = 1.23 95%CI = <br>[0.56-2.69]). Main risk factors were analogous in patients and healthy subjects.<br>CONCLUSION: Patients affected with central disorders of hypersomnolence had <br>increased risk of recent car crashes compared to subjects from the general <br>population, a finding potentially reversed by long-term treatment.<br><br>DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0129386<br>PMCID: PMC4460078<br>PMID: 26052938 [Indexed for MEDLINE]<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: Prof. Dauvilliers has <br>received speaker’s honoraria and travelling expenses for conferences from UCB <br>Pharma, Jazz, and Bioprojet.

In general, <br>medications that increase the release, or inhibit the reuptake, of <br>norepinephrine or dopamine have wake-promoting effects and are useful in <br>managing EDS, whereas medications that inhibit serotonin or norepinephrine <br>reuptake have anticataplectic effects. Modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid B <br>(GABAB) receptors or histamine H3 receptors (H3Rs) has effects on both EDS and <br>cataplexy. Pitolisant, an H3R antagonist, and solriamfetol, a dopamine and <br>norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, are the most recently approved treatments for <br>EDS associated with narcolepsy in the European Union (pitolisant) and the USA <br>(pitolisant and solriamfetol). Several new agents are being developed and tested <br>as potential treatments for EDS and cataplexy associated with narcolepsy; these <br>agents include novel oxybate formulations (once-nightly [FT218]; low sodium <br>[JZP-258]), a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (AXS-12), and a <br>product combining modafinil and an astroglial connexin inhibitor (THN102).

We assessed its diagnostic value in a <br>series of 2,083 subjects of whom 170 (8.2%) were diagnosed with narcolepsy. The <br>sensitivity of the combination of two or more sleep onset rapid eye movement <br>(REM) periods (SOREMPs) with a mean sleep latency of &lt; 5 minutes on an initial <br>MSLT was 70% with a specificity of 97%, but 30% of all subjects with this <br>combination of findings did not have narcolepsy. In some narcoleptics who had <br>more than one MSLT, the proportion of naps with SOREMPs varied substantially <br>from the initial MSLT to the follow-up test. The highest specificity (99.2%) and <br>positive predictive value (PPV) (87%) for MSLT findings was obtained with the <br>criteria of three or more SOREMPs combined with a mean sleep latency of &lt; 5 <br>minutes, but the sensitivity of this combination was only 46%. The combination <br>of a SOREMP with a sleep latency &lt; 10 minutes on polysomnography yielded a <br>specificity (98.9%) and PPV (73%) almost equal to those obtained from <br>combinations of MSLT findings, but the sensitivity was much lower. Our results <br>suggest that the MSLT cannot be used in isolation to confirm or exclude <br>narcolepsy, is indicated only in selected patients with excessive daytime <br>sleepiness, and is most valuable when interpreted in conjunction with clinical <br>findings.<br><br>PMID: 9351129 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Height, weight, arterial blood pressure, and <br>Tanner pubertal stage were evaluated. Plasma lipid and glucose profiles were <br>analyzed. When an altered pubertal development was clinically suspected, plasma <br>concentrations of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis hormones were determined. <br>Children with NC showed a high prevalence of overweight/obesity (74%) and a <br>higher occurrence of precocious puberty (17%) than obese controls (1.9%). <br>Isolated signs of accelerated pubertal development (thelarche, pubic hair, <br>advanced bone age) were also present (41%). Precocious puberty was significantly <br>predicted by a younger age at first NC symptom onset but not by <br>overweight/obesity or other factors. In addition, overweight/obesity was <br>predicted by younger age at diagnosis; additional predictors were found for <br>overweight/obesity (short disease duration, younger age at weight gain and lower <br>high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), which did not include precocious puberty. <br>NC symptoms, pubertal signs appearance, and body weight gain developed in close <br>temporal sequence.<br>CONCLUSIONS: NC occurring during prepubertal age is frequently accompanied by <br>precocious puberty and overweight/obesity, suggesting an extended hypothalamic <br>dysfunction.

We aimed to describe clinical and polysomnographic features of a <br>large narcolepsy cohort in order to comprehensively characterize the narcoleptic <br>spectrum.<br>METHODS: We performed a chart- and polysomnographybased review of all narcolepsy <br>patients of the Innsbruck narcolepsy cohort.<br>RESULTS: A total of 100 consecutive narcolepsy patients (87 with cataplexy [NC], <br>13 without cataplexy [N]) were included in the analysis. All subjects had either <br>excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy as their initial presenting clinical <br>feature. Age at symptom onset was 20 (6-69) years. Diagnostic delay was 6.5 <br>(0-39) years. The complete narcolepsy tetrad was present in 36/100 patients; <br>28/100 patients had three cardinal symptoms; 29/100 had two; and 7/100 had only <br>excessive daytime sleepiness. Severity varied broadly with respect to excessive <br>daytime sleepiness (median Epworth Sleepiness Scale score: 18, range 10-24), <br>cataplexy (8-point Likert scale: median 4.5, range 1-8), hypnagogic <br>hallucinations (median 4.5, range 1-7), and sleep paralysis (median 3, range <br>1-7). Sleep comorbidity was highly prevalent and ranged from sleeprelated <br>movement disorders (n = 55/100), parasomnias (n = 34/100), and sleeprelated <br>breathing disorders (n = 24/100), to insomnia (n = 28/100). REM sleep without <br>atonia or a periodic limb movement in sleep index &gt; 5/h were present in most <br>patients (90/100 and 75/100). A high percentage of narcoleptic patients in the <br>present study had high frequency leg movements (35%) and excessive fragmentary <br>myoclonus (22%). Of the narcolepsy patients with clinical features of REM sleep <br>behavior disorder (RBD), 76.5% had EMG evidence for RBD on the multiple sleep <br>latency test (MSLT), based on a standard cutoff of a minimum of 18% of 3-sec <br>miniepochs.<br>CONCLUSION: This study is one of the largest monocentric polysomnographic <br>studies to date of patients with narcolepsy and confirms the frequent <br>comorbidity of narcolepsy with many other sleep disorders. Our study is the <br>first to evaluate the percentage of patients with high frequency leg movements <br>and excessive fragmentary myoclonus in narcolepsy and is the first to <br>demonstrate EMG evidence of RBD in the MSLT. These findings add to the growing <br>body of literature suggesting that motor instability is a key feature of <br>narcolepsy.<br><br>DOI: 10.5664/jcsm.2926<br>PMCID: PMC3716672<br>PMID: 23946711 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Records were reviewed by a certified sleep specialist for <br>accuracy of diagnosis, and comorbidities were extracted and analyzed. <br>Comorbidities in narcolepsy subjects, both at diagnosis and upon follow-up, were <br>compared with those in unaffected and age- and sex-matched cohort using <br>conditional logistic regression.<br>RESULTS: At diagnosis, there was increased association of narcolepsy with <br>anxiety (OR 4.56, 95% CI 1.99-10.44), thyroid disease (3.07, 1.19-7.90), <br>hypertension (2.69, 1.22-5.93), and hyperlipidemia (2.49, 1.05-5.92). At the end <br>of the prolonged observation period of 9.9 years (SD 7.27 years), there was <br>increased association of narcolepsy with peripheral neuropathy (11.21, <br>1.16-108.11), non-migrainous headache (6.00, 1.73-20.83), glucose intolerance <br>(2.39, 1.05-5.45), and automobile-related trauma (2.43, 1.08-5.45). Persistently <br>increased both at diagnosis and after a prolonged observation period were <br>associations of narcolepsy with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (69.25, <br>9.26-517.99 decreasing to 13.55, 5.08-36.14), chronic low back pain (5.46, <br>2.46-12.11 to 2.58, 1.39-4.77), depression (4.88, 2.45-9.73 to 3.79, 2.12-6.79), <br>psychiatric disorders in general (4.73, 2.49-9.01 to 3.40, 1.94-5.98), <br>endocrinopathies (4.15, 1.81-9.56 to 2.45, 1.33-4.49), and obesity (2.27, <br>1.13-4.56 to 2.07, 1.15-3.7).<br>CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based study of narcolepsy comorbidities, both at <br>diagnosis and after prolonged follow-up, persistent comorbidities were revealed, <br>including OSA, chronic low back pain, psychiatric disorders in general, <br>endocrinopathies, and obesity.

Electronic address: thomas.kilduff@sri.com.<br><br>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy are common symptoms of <br>narcolepsy, a sleep disorder associated with the loss of hypocretin/orexin <br>(Hcrt) neurons. Although only a few drugs have received regulatory approval for <br>narcolepsy to date, treatment involves diverse medications that affect multiple <br>biochemical targets and neural circuits. Clinical trials have demonstrated <br>efficacy for the following classes of drugs as narcolepsy treatments: alerting <br>medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil/armodafinil, solriamfetol <br>[JZP-110]), antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin <br>reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), sodium <br>oxybate, and the H3-receptor inverse agonist/antagonist pitolisant. Enhanced <br>catecholamine availability and regulation of locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine <br>(NE) neuron activity is likely central to the therapeutic activity of most of <br>these compounds. LC NE neurons are integral to sleep/wake regulation and muscle <br>tone; reduced excitatory input to the LC due to compromise of Hcrt/orexin <br>neurons (likely due to autoimmune factors) results in LC NE dysregulation and <br>contributes to narcolepsy/cataplexy symptoms. Agents that increase <br>catecholamines and/or LC activity may mitigate EDS and cataplexy by elevating NE <br>regulation of GABAergic inputs from the amygdala. Consequently, novel <br>medications and treatment strategies aimed at preserving and/or modulating <br>Hcrt/orexin-LC circuit integrity are warranted in narcolepsy/cataplexy.<br><br>Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Electronic <br>address: meir.kryger@yale.edu.<br><br>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common complaint in the general <br>population, which may be associated with a wide range of sleep disorders and <br>other medical conditions. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized primarily <br>by EDS, which involves a substantial burden of illness but is often overlooked <br>or misdiagnosed. In addition to identifying low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <br>hypocretin (orexin) levels, evaluation for narcolepsy requires in-laboratory <br>polysomnography (PSG). Polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosis of <br>obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as well as other sleep disorders. However, the use <br>of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) to screen for OSA in adults with EDS has <br>increased greatly based on its lower cost, lower technical complexity, and <br>greater convenience, versus PSG. The most commonly used, types 3 and 4, portable <br>monitors for HSAT lack capability for electroencephalogram recording, which is <br>necessary for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders and is <br>provided by PSG. These limitations, combined with the increased use of HSAT for <br>evaluation of EDS, may further exacerbate the under-recognition of narcolepsy <br>and other hypersomnias, either as primary or comorbid disorders with OSA. <br>Adherence to expert consensus guidelines for use of HSAT is essential. <br>Differential clinical characteristics of patients with narcolepsy and OSA may <br>help guide correct diagnosis. Continued EDS in patients diagnosed and treated <br>for OSA may indicate comorbid narcolepsy or another sleep disorder. Although <br>HSAT may diagnose OSA in appropriately selected patients, it cannot rule out or <br>diagnose narcolepsy. Therefore, at present, PSG and MSLT remain the cornerstone <br>for narcolepsy diagnosis.<br><br>Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Electronic address: giuseppe.plazzi@unibo.it.<br><br>Narcolepsy type 1 is a life-long, severe, multifaceted disease often arising in <br>childhood or adolescence. Beyond the classical symptoms (excessive daytime <br>sleepiness, cataplexy, hallucinations, sleep paralysis and nocturnal fragmented <br>sleep), metabolic, endocrinological, psychiatric and psychosocial aspects must <br>be considered. Despite the increased awareness after H1N1 pandemic influenza and <br>vaccination, narcolepsy is still misdiagnosed and unrecognized. The peculiar <br>presentation of symptoms in narcoleptic children could in part explain the <br>misdiagnoses. Excessive daytime sleepiness presenting as chronic drowsiness or <br>irritability could be stigmatized as laziness or misinterpreted as behavior or <br>inattention disorder. The persistent hypotonia and the complex hyperkinetic <br>movements that characterize cataplexy close to the onset, could be misdiagnosed <br>as a movement disorder or as other neurologic conditions. The consequent <br>therapeutic delay could turn into dramatic consequences. The narcolepsy onset, <br>indeed, is associated with abrupt weight gain and sometimes with precocious <br>puberty that require a prompt recognition and treatment to avoid auxological and <br>metabolic complications. Moreover, narcoleptic children could have behavioral <br>and psychiatric disorders ranging from mood to psychotic ones that need ad hoc <br>management. Accordingly, spreading the awareness outside the sleep specialist <br>community is necessary in order to reduce the diagnostic delay and to obtain <br>prompt and multidisciplinary management.<br><br>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

POJE@glo.regionh.dk<br><br>BACKGROUND: Narcolepsy is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a typical <br>onset in childhood or early adulthood. Narcolepsy may have serious negative <br>effects on health-, social-, education-, and work-related issues for people with <br>narcolepsy and for their families. The disease may, thus, present a significant <br>socioeconomic burden, but no studies to date have addressed the indirect and <br>direct costs of narcolepsy.<br>METHODS: Using records from the Danish National Patient Registry (1998-2005), we <br>identified 459 Danish patients with the diagnosis of narcolepsy. Using a ratio <br>of 1 patient record to 4 control subjects' records, we then compared the <br>information of patients with narcolepsy with that of 1836 records from age- and <br>sex-matched, randomly chosen citizens in the Danish Civil Registration System <br>Statistics. We calculated the annual direct and indirect health costs, including <br>labor supply and social transfer payments (which include income derived from <br>state coffers, such as subsistence allowances, pensions, social security, social <br>assistance, public personal support for education, etc.). Direct costs included <br>frequencies and costs of hospitalizations and weighted outpatient use, according <br>to diagnosis-related groups, and specific outpatient costs based on data from <br>The Danish Ministry of Health. The use of and costs of drugs were based on data <br>from the Danish Medicines Agency. The frequencies and costs from primary sectors <br>were based on data from The National Health Security. Indirect costs were based <br>on income data derived from data from the Coherent Social Statistics.<br>RESULTS: Patients with narcolepsy had significantly higher rates of <br>health-related contact and medication use and higher expenses, as compared with <br>control subjects. They also had higher unemployment rates. The income level of <br>patients with narcolepsy who were employed was lower than that of employed <br>control subjects. The annual total direct and indirect costs were euro 11,654 <br>(euro = Eurodollars) for patients with narcolepsy and euro 1430 for control <br>subjects (p &lt; 0.001), corresponding to an annual mean excess health-related cost <br>of euro 10,223 for each patient with narcolepsy. In addition, the patients with <br>narcolepsy received an annual social transfer income of euro 2588.<br>CONCLUSION: The study confirms that narcolepsy has major socioeconomic <br>consequences for the individual patient and for society. Early diagnosis and <br>treatment could potentially reduce disease burden, which would have a <br>significant socioeconomic impact.<br><br>PMCID: PMC2699169<br>PMID: 19960645 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Besides a role in sleep, hypocretins are also involved in regulation of <br>heart rate and blood pressure. This literature review examines data on the <br>autonomic effects of hypocretin deficiency and evidence about how narcolepsy is <br>associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, <br>including cardiovascular disease. An important impact in NT1 is lack of <br>nocturnal blood pressure dipping, which has been associated with mortality in <br>the general population. Hypertension is also prevalent in NT1. Furthermore, <br>disrupted nighttime sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness, which are <br>characteristic of narcolepsy, may increase cardiovascular risk. Patients with <br>narcolepsy also often present with other comorbidities (eg, obesity, diabetes, <br>depression, other sleep disorders) that may contribute to increased <br>cardiovascular risk.

Behavior and quality of life were evaluated by <br>self-administered questionnaires (Child Behavior Checklist, Pediatric Quality of <br>Life Inventory). Patient groups were contrasted and scale results were <br>correlated with clinical and polysomnographic parameters, and cerebrospinal <br>fluid hypocretin-1 levels.<br>RESULTS: Young patients with NT1 showed increased internalizing problems <br>associated with aggressive behavior. Emotional profile in patients with NT1 <br>positively correlated with age at onset, diagnostic delay, and subjective <br>sleepiness, whereas treatment and disease duration were associated with fewer <br>behavioral problems (attention problems, aggressive behavior, and attention <br>deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Psychosocial health domains of pediatric NT1 <br>were worse than in healthy controls, whereas the physical health domains were <br>comparable.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Young NT1 patients show a discrete pattern of altered behavioral, <br>thought, and mood profile in comparison with healthy controls and with <br>idiopathic epilepsy patients thus suggesting a direct link with sleepiness. <br>Further studies investigating behavior in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia <br>or type 2 narcolepsy are needed to disentangle the role of REM sleep dysfunction <br>and hypocretin deficiency in psychiatric disorders.

Recently, the childhood NT1 diagnoses have increased for <br>improved disease awareness and for several cases occurring after the H1N1 <br>pandemic influenza or vaccination. As in adults, the occurrence of NT1 in <br>individuals with a genetic predisposition of the immune system (e.g., human <br>leukocyte antigen, HLA-DQB1*0602) together with the role of environmental <br>triggers (e.g., H1N1 influenza virus, streptococcus β hemolyticus) further <br>supports the autoimmune pathogenesis. Children with NT1 close to disease onset <br>show a peculiar cataplexy phenotype characterized by persistent hypotonia with <br>prominent facial involvement (cataplectic facies) and by a complex mosaic of <br>hyperkinetic movement abnormalities that increase during emotional stimulation. <br>This phenotype progressively vanishes along the disease course leading to the <br>typical picture of cataplexy (i.e., muscle weakness exclusively evoked by strong <br>emotions). This possibly explains in part the misdiagnoses and diagnostic delay. <br>Childhood NT1 also shows behavioral abnormalities and psychiatric disorders, <br>encompassing depressive feelings, hyperactive/aggressive behavior, up to <br>psychotic features. The association with obesity and precocious puberty <br>strikingly suggests that NT1 arising in prepubertal children may reflect a wide <br>hypothalamic derangement secondary to hypocretin neuronal loss. The complexity <br>of the childhood NT1 phenotype claims a multidisciplinary assessment and <br>management, taking behavioral and endocrinological features into account. NT1 <br>indeed is a lifelong disorder with a devastating impact on quality of life, <br>especially when arising across developmental age, and targeted school programs, <br>medicolegal and psychological supports are essential for patients care. <br>Controlled studies are mandatory to assess safety and efficacy of the current <br>symptomatic off-label medications on which also relies the treatment for <br>children with NT1, and hopefully future pathogenetic evidences will pave the way <br>to better disease prevention and therapies to modify the disease course.<br><br>Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.<br><br>DOI: 10.1055/s-0035-1550152<br>PMID: 25961600 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Electronic address: thomas.kilduff@sri.com.<br><br>Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that afflicts 1 in 2000 individuals and is <br>characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy-a sudden loss of <br>muscle tone triggered by positive emotions. Features of narcolepsy include <br>dysregulation of arousal state boundaries as well as autonomic and metabolic <br>disturbances. Disruption of neurotransmission through the hypocretin/orexin <br>(Hcrt) system, usually by degeneration of the HCRT-producing neurons in the <br>posterior hypothalamus, results in narcolepsy. The cause of Hcrt <br>neurodegeneration is unknown but thought to be related to autoimmune processes. <br>Current treatments for narcolepsy are symptomatic, including wake-promoting <br>therapeutics that increase presynaptic dopamine release and anticataplectic <br>agents that activate monoaminergic neurotransmission. Sodium oxybate is the only <br>medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that alleviates both <br>sleep/wake disturbances and cataplexy. Development of therapeutics for <br>narcolepsy has been challenged by historical misunderstanding of the disease, <br>its many disparate symptoms and, until recently, its unknown etiology. Animal <br>models have been essential to elucidating the neuropathology underlying <br>narcolepsy. These models have also aided understanding the neurobiology of the <br>Hcrt system, mechanisms of cataplexy, and the pharmacology of narcolepsy <br>medications. Transgenic rodent models will be critical in the development of <br>novel therapeutics for the treatment of narcolepsy, particularly efforts <br>directed to overcome challenges in the development of hypocretin replacement <br>therapy.<br><br>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A low <br>level of hypocretin-1/orexin-A in the cerebrospinal fluid is sufficient to <br>diagnose narcolepsy type 1, being a highly specific and sensitive biomarker, and <br>the irreversible loss of hypocretin neurons is responsible for the main symptoms <br>of the disease: sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations and <br>paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. The process responsible for the <br>destruction of hypocretin neurons is highly suspected to be autoimmune, or <br>dysimmune. Over the last two decades, remarkable progress has been made for the <br>understanding of these mechanisms that were made possible with the development <br>of new techniques. Conversely, narcolepsy type 2 is a less well-defined <br>disorder, with a variable phenotype and evolution, and few reliable biomarkers <br>discovered so far. There is a dearth of knowledge about this disorder, and its <br>aetiology remains unclear and needs to be further explored. Treatment of <br>narcolepsy is still nowadays only symptomatic, targeting sleepiness, cataplexy <br>and disrupted nocturnal sleep. However, new psychostimulants have been recently <br>developed, and the upcoming arrival of non-peptide hypocretin receptor-2 <br>agonists should be a revolution in the management of this rare sleep disease, <br>and maybe also for disorders beyond narcolepsy.<br><br>© 2022 European Sleep Research Society.<br><br>DOI: 10.1111/jsr.13631<br>PMID: 35624073 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Cataplexy is most commonly <br>associated with and considered pathognomonic for narcolepsy, a sleep disorder <br>affecting ~0.05% of the general population. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of <br>cataplexy has advanced through study of canine, murine, and human models. It is <br>now generally considered that loss of signaling by hypothalamic <br>hypocretin/orexin-producing neurons plays a key role in the development of <br>cataplexy. Although the cause of hypocretin/orexin neuron loss in narcolepsy <br>with cataplexy is unknown, an autoimmune etiology is widely hypothesized. <br>Despite these advances, a literature review shows that treatment of cataplexy <br>remains limited. Multiple classes of antidepressants have been commonly used <br>off-label for cataplexy in narcolepsy and are suggested for this use in expert <br>consensus guidelines based on traditional practice, case reports, and small <br>trials. However, systematic research evidence supporting antidepressants for <br>cataplexy is lacking. The single pharmacotherapy indicated for cataplexy and the <br>guideline-recommended first-line treatment in Europe and the US is sodium <br>oxybate, the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Clinical trial evidence of <br>its efficacy and safety in cataplexy is robust, and it is hypothesized that its <br>therapeutic effects may occur through gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type <br>B-mediated effects at noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and thalamocortical neurons. <br>Additional possible mechanisms for cataplexy therapy suggested by preliminary <br>research include antagonism of the histamine H3 autoreceptor with pitolisant and <br>intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for amelioration of the presumed <br>autoimmune-mediated hypocretin/orexin cell loss. Further research and <br>development of therapeutic approaches to cataplexy are needed.<br><br>DOI: 10.2147/NSS.S92140<br>PMCID: PMC4686331<br>PMID: 26715865</p>

There has been a lack of clarity <br>regarding the definition of DNS, as many sleep-related symptoms and conditions <br>disrupt sleep quality in narcolepsy (eg, hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid <br>eye movement sleep behavior disorder, nightmares, restless legs <br>syndrome/periodic leg movements, nocturnal eating, sleep apnea, depression, <br>anxiety).

DNS <br>impairs quality of life among people with narcolepsy, and more research is <br>needed to determine its contributions to cardiovascular risk. Multimodal <br>treatment is appropriate for DNS management, including behavioral therapies, <br>counseling on sleep hygiene, and/or medication.

Box 61, , 5590 AB, Heeze, The <br>Netherlands.<br>(7)Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.<br><br>This review describes the diagnosis and management of cataplexy: attacks of <br>bilateral loss of muscle tone, triggered by emotions and with preserved <br>consciousness. Although cataplexy is rare, its recognition is important as in <br>most cases, it leads to a diagnosis of narcolepsy, a disorder that still takes a <br>median of 9 years to be diagnosed. The expression of cataplexy varies widely, <br>from partial episodes affecting only the neck muscles to generalized attacks <br>leading to falls. Moreover, childhood cataplexy differs from the presentation in <br>adults, with a prominent facial involvement, already evident without clear <br>emotional triggers ('cataplectic facies') and 'active' motor phenomena <br>especially of the tongue and perioral muscles. Next to narcolepsy, cataplexy can <br>sometimes be caused by other diseases, such as Niemann-Pick type C, Prader Willi <br>Syndrome, or lesions in the hypothalamic or pontomedullary region. Cataplexy <br>mimics include syncope, epilepsy, hyperekplexia, drop attacks and <br>pseudocataplexy. They can be differentiated from cataplexy using thorough <br>history taking, supplemented with (home)video recordings whenever possible. <br>Childhood narcolepsy, with its profound facial hypotonia, can be confused with <br>neuromuscular disorders, and the active motor phenomenona resemble those found <br>in childhood movement disorders such as Sydenham's chorea. Currently, the <br>diagnosis of cataplexy is made almost solely on clinical grounds, based on <br>history taking and (home) videos. Cataplexy shows remarkable differences in <br>childhood compared to adults, with profound facial hypotonia and complex active <br>motor phenomena. Over time, these severe symptoms evolve to the milder adult <br>phenotype, and this pattern is crucial to recognize when assessing the outcome <br>of uncontrolled case series with potential treatments such as immunomodulation. <br>Symptomatic treatment is possible with antidepressants and sodium oxybate. <br>Importantly, management also needs to involve sleep hygiene advice, safety <br>measures whenever applicable and guidance with regard to the social sequelae of <br>cataplexy.<br><br>DOI: 10.1007/s11940-017-0459-0<br>PMID: 28478511</p>

Dysfunction of the hypocretin/orexin system has been implicated as <br>the underlying cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy. In most people with <br>narcolepsy, symptom onset occurs between the ages of 10 and 35 years, but <br>because the disorder is underrecognized and testing is complex, delays in <br>diagnosis and treatment are common. Narcolepsy is treated with a combination of <br>lifestyle modifications and medications that promote wakefulness and suppress <br>cataplexy. Treatments are often effective in improving daytime functioning for <br>individuals with narcolepsy, but side effects and/or lack of efficacy can result <br>in suboptimal management of symptoms and, in many cases, significant residual <br>impairment. Additionally, the psychosocial ramifications of narcolepsy are often <br>neglected. Recently two new pharmacologic treatment options, solriamfetol and <br>pitolisant, have been approved for adults, and the indication for sodium oxybate <br>in narcolepsy has been expanded to include children. In recent years, there has <br>been an uptick in patient-centered research, and promising new diagnostic and <br>therapeutic options are in development. This paper summarizes current and <br>prospective pharmacological therapies for treating both EDS and cataplexy, <br>discusses concerns specific to children and reproductive-age women with <br>narcolepsy, and reviews the negative impact of health-related stigma and efforts <br>to address narcolepsy stigma.<br><br>© 2020 Barker et al.<br><br>DOI: 10.2147/NSS.S162762<br>PMCID: PMC7371435<br>PMID: 32765142<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: Dr. Emily C.

Shortening the NT1 diagnostic delay is the key to reduce <br>disease burden and related low quality of life. Here we investigated the changes <br>of diagnostic delay over the diagnostic years (1990-2018) and the factors <br>associated with the delay in Europe.<br>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 580 NT1 patients (male: 325, female: 255) from <br>12 European countries using the European Narcolepsy Network database. We <br>combined machine learning and linear mixed-effect regression to identify factors <br>associated with the delay.<br>RESULTS: The mean age at EDS onset and diagnosis of our patients was 20.9±11.8 <br>(mean ± standard deviation) and 30.5±14.9 years old, respectively. Their mean <br>and median diagnostic delay was 9.7±11.5 and 5.3 (interquartile range: 1.7-13.2 <br>years) years, respectively. We did not find significant differences in the <br>diagnostic delay over years in either the whole dataset or in individual <br>countries, although the delay showed significant differences in various <br>countries. The number of patients with short (≤2-year) and long (≥13-year) <br>diagnostic delay equally increased over decades, suggesting that subgroups of <br>NT1 patients with variable disease progression may co-exist. Younger age at <br>cataplexy onset, longer interval between EDS and cataplexy onsets, lower <br>cataplexy frequency, shorter duration of irresistible daytime sleep, lower <br>daytime REM sleep propensity, and being female are associated with longer <br>diagnostic delay.<br>CONCLUSION: Our findings contrast the results of previous studies reporting <br>shorter delay over time which is confounded by calendar year, because they <br>characterized the changes in diagnostic delay over the symptom onset year. Our <br>study indicates that new strategies such as increasing media attention/awareness <br>and developing new biomarkers are needed to better detect EDS, cataplexy, and <br>changes of nocturnal sleep in narcolepsy, in order to shorten the diagnostic <br>interval.<br><br>© 2022 Zhang et al.<br><br>DOI: 10.2147/NSS.S359980<br>PMCID: PMC9166906<br>PMID: 35669411<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: Prof. Dr. Giuseppe Plazzi reports personal fees <br>from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Takeda, Idorsia, and Bioprojet, outside the submitted <br>work.

Electronic address: <br>ydauvilliers@yahoo.fr.<br><br>Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and type 2 (NT2), also known as narcolepsy with and <br>without cataplexy, are sleep disorders that benefited from major scientific <br>advances over the last two decades. NT1 is caused by the loss of hypothalamic <br>neurons producing orexin/hypocretin, a neurotransmitter regulating sleep and <br>wake, which can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A low CSF level of <br>hypocretin-1/orexin-A is a highly specific and sensitive biomarker, sufficient <br>to diagnose NT1. Orexin-deficiency is responsible for the main NT1 symptoms: <br>sleepiness, cataplexy, disrupted nocturnal sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, <br>and sleep paralysis. In the absence of a lumbar puncture, the diagnosis is based <br>on neurophysiological tests (nocturnal and diurnal) and the presence of the <br>pathognomonic symptom cataplexy. In the revised version of the International <br>Classification of sleep Disorders, 3rd edition (ICSD-3-TR), a sleep onset rapid <br>eye movement sleep (REM) period (SOREMP) (i.e. rapid occurrence of REM sleep) <br>during the previous polysomnography may replace the diurnal multiple sleep <br>latency test, when clear-cut cataplexy is present. A nocturnal SOREMP is very <br>specific but not sensitive enough, and the diagnosis of cataplexy is usually <br>based on clinical interview. It is thus of crucial importance to define typical <br>versus atypical cataplectic attacks, and a list of clinical features and related <br>degrees of certainty is proposed in this paper (expert opinion). The time frame <br>of at least three months of evolution of sleepiness to diagnose NT1 was removed <br>in the ICSD-3-TR, when clear-cut cataplexy or orexin-deficiency are established. <br>However, it was kept for NT2 diagnosis, a less well-characterized disorder with <br>unknown clinical course and absence of biolo biomarkers; sleep deprivation, <br>shift working and substances intake being major differential diagnoses. <br>Treatment of narcolepsy is nowadays only symptomatic, but the upcoming arrival <br>of non-peptide orexin receptor-2 agonists should be a revolution in the <br>management of these rare sleep diseases.<br><br>Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Individuals suffering from <br>narcolepsy exhibit excessive daytime somnolence, sleep attacks, cataplexy, <br>dysomnia, metabolic perturbations including weight gain, and problems in social <br>interaction and academic performance. The prevalence of narcolepsy in childhood <br>is not known but can be estimated from adult studies to be greater than 20-60 <br>per 100,000 in Western countries. The 2009 (A) H1N1 vaccination campaign led to <br>an increase of narcoleptic cases both in children and in adults, supporting the <br>autoimmune hypothesis of the disease. This article focuses on the epidemiology, <br>etiology, and particularities of treatment in pediatric narcolepsy and details <br>the effects of the drugs used to treat this condition, including recent trends <br>in the field. Future therapeutic directions are also discussed. At present, <br>medications used to treat children or adolescents have shown efficacy mostly <br>based on clinical experience, given the lack of level 1 evidence-based studies <br>in the pediatric population. Therefore, most compounds used in adult narcolepsy <br>to target clinical symptoms such as wake-promoting or anticataplectic agents are <br>prescribed off-label in pediatric patients. Published research shows the benefit <br>of drug therapy for narcoleptic children, but these must be dispensed with <br>caution in the absence of well conducted clinical trials.<br><br>DOI: 10.1007/s40272-014-0083-3<br>PMID: 25074415 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

The exact underlying <br>process leading to this destruction is yet unknown, but indirect evidence <br>strongly supports an autoimmune origin. The association with immune-related <br>genetic factors, in particular the strongest association ever reported in a <br>disease with an allele of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene, and with <br>environmental factors (i.e., the H1N1 influenza infection and vaccination during <br>the pandemic in 2009) are in favor of such a hypothesis. The loss of Hcrt <br>neurons is irreversible, and NT1 is currently an incurable and disabling <br>condition. Patients are managed with symptomatic medication, targeting the main <br>symptoms (excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, disturbed nocturnal sleep), <br>and they require a lifelong treatment. Improved diagnostic tools, together with <br>an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of NT1, may lead to new <br>therapeutic and even preventive interventions. One future treatment could <br>include Hcrt replacement, but this neuropeptide does not cross the blood-brain <br>barrier. However, Hcrt receptor agonists may be promising candidates to treat <br>NT1. Another option is immune-based therapies, administered at disease onset, <br>with already some initiatives to slow down or stop the dysimmune process. <br>Whether immune-based therapy could be beneficial in NT1 remains, however, to be <br>proven.<br><br>DOI: 10.1007/s40263-017-0464-6<br>PMID: 28940143 [Indexed for MEDLINE]</p>

Namely, REM sleep plays an imperative role in the <br>maturation of the central nervous system. In coincidence with a rapidly <br>developing brain during the early period of life, a remarkably large amount of <br>REM sleep has been identified in numerous behavioral and polysomnographic <br>studies across species. The abundant REM sleep appears to serve to optimize a <br>cerebral state suitable for homeostasis and inherent neuronal activities <br>favorable to brain maturation, ranging from neuronal differentiation, migration, <br>and myelination to synaptic formation and elimination. Progressively more <br>studies in Mammalia have provided the underlying mechanisms involved in some REM <br>sleep-related disorders (e.g., narcolepsy, autism, attention deficit <br>hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)). We summarize the remarkable alterations of <br>polysomnographic, behavioral, and physiological characteristics in humans and <br>Mammalia. Through a comprehensive review, we offer a hybrid of animal and human <br>findings, demonstrating that early-life REM sleep disturbances constitute a <br>common feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders. Our review may assist and <br>promote investigations of the underlying mechanisms, functions, and <br>neurodevelopmental diseases involved in REM sleep during early life.<br><br>DOI: 10.3390/ijerph192013101<br>PMCID: PMC9602694<br>PMID: 36293678 [Indexed for MEDLINE]<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p>

The evaluation of <br>sleepiness requires rigorous clinical and neurophysiologic approaches that may <br>include the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, multiple sleep latency tests, and the <br>maintenance of wakefulness test. However, to date, no gold standard measurement <br>of excessive sleepiness exists, and there are no quantifiable biologic markers. <br>The main pathophysiologic feature of central hypersomnias is thought to reflect <br>a deficiency of arousal systems, rather than an overactivity of sleep systems or <br>an imbalance between those systems. Impaired neurotransmission of <br>hypocretin/orexin (neuropeptides of the lateral hypothalamus) is involved in the <br>neurobiology of narcolepsy with cataplexy (NT1). NT1 is a well-characterized <br>disorder, due to the destruction of hypocretin/orexin neurons by a probable <br>autoimmune process. The biologic hallmarks of the other central hypersomnias <br>remain unknown, and neurophysiologic biomarkers are still of major importance <br>for the diagnosis and characterization of those disorders.<br><br>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Diagnostic delay is a persistent problem, <br>with obvious detrimental effects on patients. A diagnosis of narcolepsy may be <br>delayed because of its broad symptom presentation which is much more <br>encompassing than the classical "tetrad" of sleepiness, cataplexy, <br>hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Furthermore, symptoms can vary over time. <br>Presentation of symptoms can also be markedly different between children and <br>adults. Finally, common sleep-related comorbidities increase the risk of <br>narcolepsy being masked by overlapping symptoms or treatment. In this review, we <br>provide a detailed description of the broad and dynamic symptom spectrum of <br>narcolepsy, with specific attention to the different manifestations in both <br>adults and children.

REM <br>sleep disturbances can manifest as cataplexy (in narcolepsy type 1), sleep <br>paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, abnormal <br>dreams, polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep disruption with sleep-onset REM <br>periods, and fragmented REM sleep. Characterization of REM sleep and related <br>symptoms facilitates the differentiation of narcolepsy from other central <br>hypersomnolence disorders and aids in distinguishing between narcolepsy types 1 <br>and 2. A circuit comprising regions within the brainstem, forebrain, and <br>hypothalamus is involved in generating and regulating REM sleep, which is <br>influenced by changes in monoamines, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides.

NT1 symptoms are due to hypocretin <br>deficiency. The cause for the observed hypocretin deficiency remains unclear, <br>even though the most likely hypothesis is that this is due to an auto-immune <br>process. The search for autoantibodies and autoreactive T-cells has not yet <br>produced conclusive evidence for or against the auto-immune hypothesis. Other <br>mechanisms, such as reduced corticotrophin-releasing hormone production in the <br>paraventricular nucleus have recently been suggested. There is no reversive <br>treatment, and the therapeutic approach is symptomatic. Early diagnosis and <br>appropriate NT1 treatment is essential, especially in children to prevent <br>impaired cognitive, emotional and social development. Hypocretin receptor <br>agonists have been designed to replace the attenuated hypocretin signalling. <br>Pre-clinical and clinical trials have shown encouraging initial results.
